                       By way of introduction, a brief clarifi-
                       cation of concepts. First, what the concept 
                       of "analysis" encompasses: In ordinary con-
                       versation one usually hears mention of 
                       chemists' analyses. For instance, a certain 
                       preparation sells well due to its excellent 
                       effect. The manufacturer's profits make 
                       other manufacturers curious, and they 
                       take a sample of it to the chemist so 
                       that he can analyze it. He must proceed 
                       methodically in order to break the prepa-
                       ration down into its component parts. To 
                       solve the riddle.

                    <p>
                       In another case, a stimulant proves to have 
                       grave consequences for health. Here also the 
                       chemist must be called upon to reveal the 
                       harmful components through an analysis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       In both cases the given substance is a 
                       whole composed of different, initially unknown
                    </p>
                <pb/> 
                    <p>
                       parts; the components are what is sought after.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       In our business, the motives or 
                       inducements that lead us to make analyses 
                       are of course different. We do not analyze 
                       works that we would like to copy, nor works 
                       we have reason to distrust.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       We investigate the paths that 
                       another has followed in the creation of 
                       a work in order, by becoming familiar 
                       with these paths, to get going ourselves.
                       This type of examination should prevent 
                       us from regarding the work as something 
                       rigid, immutably fixed. By means of such 
                       exercises we can prevent ourselves from 
                       sneaking up on a finished work only to 
                       quickly pluck up what stands out the 
                       most and run off with it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       A special type of analysis is the

                <pb/> 
                    <p>
                       examination of the work through the stages 
                       of its emergence. I designate this type with 
                       the word "genesis." The first book of Moses, 
                       which deals with the creation of the world, 
                       is also called Genesis. There it is written 
                       what God created on the first day, what 
                       on the second, and so forth. The universe 
                       surrounding us undergoes a historical 
                       articulation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       We are makers, working practitioners, 
                       and hence it is natural that here we shall 
                       move chiefly in a formal domain, all the 
                       while not forgetting that before the formal 
                       beginning, or (put more simply) before the 
                       first stroke, lies an entire prehistory: not 
                       only, say, the yearning, the human desire 
                       to express oneself, not only the outward 
                       necessity to do so, but also a general human 
                       condition, whose orientation is called a 
                       weltanschauung, which, with an inner necessity,
                    </p>
                <pb/> 
                    <p>
                       urges its manifestation in this or that 
                       direction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       I emphasize this lest the misunder-
                       standing arise that a work consists only 
                       of form.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       But on the other hand, I must empha-
                       size here even more that the most precise 
                       scientific knowledge of nature, plants, 
                       animals, the earth and its history, or 
                       of the stars is useless to us if we are 
                       not provided with all the tools for their 
                       representation; that the profoundest 
                       understanding of the synergy of these 
                       things in the universe is of no use to 
                       us if we are not also equipped with forms 
                       directed towards that purpose; that the 
                       deepest feeling, the most beautiful soul, 
                       is useless unless we have the proper forms 
                       at hand.

                       After these general premises, I shall 
                       begin where the pictorial form actually 
                       begins, with the point that sets itself

                        promptly emerges. (The more freely it takes

                        nature will be.)

                    <p>
                        So let us tarry for the moment with the most 
                        primitive device: with the line. In the pre-
                        history of peoples, where writing and drawing 
                        still coincide, it is the given element. Also our

                    <p>
                        children usually begin in this way. One day 
                        they discover the phenomenon of the mobile 
                        point, and one can scarcely imagine their 
                        enthusiasm. With the greatest of freedom, 
                        the pen initially moves wherever it pleases. 
                        Once these first works are examined, 
                        however, the discovery is immediately made 
                        that the paths traversed have now become 
                        fixed in ink. Now then, children who 
                        continue to take pleasure in chaos are of 
                        course not image-makers, but other children 
                        will soon progress to a certain order. 
                        The critique of the journeys made by the 
                        pen begins. The chaos of the initial play 
                        gives way to an incipient conformity to set 
                        principles and patterns.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The freedom with which the line is 
                        guided submits to the anticipated final 
                        effect. Now, out of caution, one begins 
                        to work with very few lines to achieve an 
                        effect. One remains primitive.
                    </p>
                <pb/> 
                    <p>
                        Yet one cannot persist stubbornly in this 
                        primitivity. One will have to discover a 
                        means of enriching the meager end result 
                        without destroying or blurring the simple, 
                        clear arrangement. One must classify.

                        on. One might say it is rather more like 
                        running errands than taking a stroll. The 
                        straight lines indicate as much. But both 
                        the free line and the line with a time 
                        limit are of a purely active type.

                        As a line it is marked by its calming 
                        character and by its lack of a beginning or 
                        an end. Considered in elemental terms (as an 
                        action of the hand) it is certainly still 
                        a line, but once it has been completed, 
                        the mental image of linearity is superseded 
                        immediately by that of planarity. With it, 
                        the mobile character also disappears (no one 
                        looking at the disk of the moon would attempt 
                        to ride a carousel around its perifery), 
                        replaced by the notion of the most complete 
                        quiescence (chiefly in the instance of the 
                        circle).

                        character.

                        One indeed also sees lines, but it is not 
                        a matter of linear actions but of the linear 
                        results of planar actions. The line is not 
                        made but rather is suffered.

                        We were occupied 14 days ago with, among other 
                        things, the free line. I chose as an example a type 
                        that corresponded to a relaxing walk, without an 
                        express purpose, without an express goal.

                        This line had a certain inherent quiescence 
                        and harmony, and as a theme in a composition its 
                        realization would have required accompanying forms 
                        and so would have corresponded more to the folk-
                        song form in music than to a more artistic form.

                        Sure enough, only accompanying forms or substitute

                        The essential difference between this new

                        convergence is best illustrated if we think 
                        of each line, for instance, as the path taken 
                        by a person. You can speak of friendship in 
                        the previous examples; there is no drifting 
                        apart. But with this new divergent example 
                        we see our fellow stroller crossing our path

                        about this? Because these lines

                        Railway tracks that are 
                        constantly spreading further 
                        apart would result in the 
                        loveliest derailment. Or,

                        How does this happen, then? Well, without noticing, 
                        we have stepped out of the concept of planarity 
                        into the territory of space, into the third 
                        dimension. We are doing perspective.

                    <p>
                        Last time, we established with regret, first 
                        of all, that we have no kind of spatial writing: 
                        Unlike the movement from points <seg><figure xml:id="lesson2_figureA"></figure></seg> to lines
                        or the movement from lines <seg><figure xml:id="lesson2_figureB"></figure></seg> to planes, we cannot
                        analogously move
                        <seg><figure xml:id="lesson2_figureC"></figure></seg> planes forth with any visible effect, so 
                        as to produce solids. We must therefore make do 
                        with perspective.

                        But it will not take long to explain nor 
                        prove difficult if we confine ourselves to its 
                        principal features. And the explication of the 
                        inherent phenomena is quite remarkable!

                        crossties. How do I depict this? 
                        If I had drawn tracks on the 
                        plane, like a surveyor or carto-

                        Just as on the plane of the floor the vertical

                        Inside the now familiar space I have constructed 
                        a second one that offers the eye a view of its upper 
                        plane. Hence, one can speak more aptly of a volume 
                        than of a spatiality that ends within our eye's visual 
                        field, since actual spaces extend beyond our visual 
                        field. (We are inside them.) Thus, a volume that 
                        offers the eye a view of its upper plane.

                    <p>
                        In this case the volume does not offer a  
                        top view of its upper plane. If we assume it  
                        is made of glass, then it offers, on the contrary,  
                        a view of this plane from below.

                        Such a horizontal plane that can be seen  
                        from below, however, is situated above our eye; <seg><figure xml:id="lesson2_figureF"></figure></seg>
                        it is higher than we are.

                        The other horizontal plane our eye sees from 
                        above is lower than our eye; it lies below us.<seg><figure xml:id="lesson2_figureG"></figure></seg>

                        <seg><figure xml:id="lesson2_fig25"></figure></seg>In this third case, 
                        however, something 
                        special occurs. The  
                        eye is unable to re- 
                        cognize the upper plane 
                        as such, whether from  
                        above or from below;  
                        rather, it appears

                        line.
                        The volume is thus 
                        exactly as high as 
                        our eye.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (Splitting hairs, one could add that the lengthwise 
                        and crosswise graduation coincide.)

                    <p>
                        What is valid for this horizontal plane 
                        is logically valid also for the corresponding 
                        horizontal lines on both side walls. These 
                        horizontal lines at eye level appear again as 
                        horizontal in the perspectival projection.

                        attraction. The feeling for the vertical is alive 
                        in us so that we do not fall, and if we must, we 
                        correctively stretch out our arms so as to again 
                        balance out the error. In exceptional cases we 
                        extend the horizontal, like the tight-rope walker

                        be verified or investigated by means of a very simple 
                        apparatus. A pane of glass is brought into a fixed vertical 
                        position and placed near the eyes in front of the object 
                        to be projected. The observations must be made with one 
                        eye, fixed in its position. With ink or grease pencil the 
                        important essential lines of the object are drawn onto the 
                        pane of glass. <seg><figure xml:id="lesson2_figureK"></figure></seg>
                        Lines recorded on a pane of glass that is not standing 
                        vertically will be seen as incorrect, distorted images. 
                        Similar distorted images are produced by photographers who, 
                        from a low angle, take pictures of an object that can be 
                        easily controlled in <seg><figure xml:id="lesson2_figureL"></figure></seg>
                        perspective, for <seg><figure xml:id="lesson2_figureM"></figure></seg>
                        example, a house.

                        fore are wider. But that is where a human being objects, 
                        because one wants to have the horizontal and the vertical 
                        fixed so that one does not begin to wobble, to get 
                        dizzy. The value of this whole procedure lies simply in 
                        the possibility of controlling, of monitoring. Drawing 
                        in correct perspective has therefore no value, because 
                        everyone can do it in this way.

                        Today I would like to make the weighing of  
                        forces on either side the object of our 
                        investigation, namely, those forces that result 
                        from the earth's force of attraction, in other 
                        words, the weighing-up of weights. Forces of this 
                        kind are closest to us, since we ourselves are  
                        physically subject to these same laws of weight. 
                        For this, we still want to assume the solid 
                        ground on which we usually stand,  and not 
                        (as happens exceptionally) go into the water or 
                        indeed the air.

                        As an instrument for this weighing, a pair of 
                        scales can be as useful to us as it is to the 
                        grocer in his shop.

                        A set of scales looks roughly like this. It 
                        weighs two weights against each other and, 
                        as there are only two, they can operate in

                        extends over three axes, AB, CD, and EF. With 
                        these scales one can ascertain the weights on 
                        the walls of a space constructed as a hexagon

                        of forces occurs are usually bounded, for example,

                        linear and one planar. Conceived in terms of lines, 
                        it is a quadrilateral with both diagonals; in terms 
                        of planes, it is a quadrilateral divided into four  
                        triangles. These four triangles arrange themselves, 
                        particularly if we do not take the quadrilateral 
                        as a square, as two pairs of triangles lying 
                        opposite each other.

                        The primitive simplicity of this case of a 
                        balancing act has allowed me to proceed 
                        symbolically, so to speak. The result is of a 
                        symmetrical nature, because the same kind of 
                        weights are on both sides.

                        A state of equilibrium diverging from 
                        symmetry could be illustrated with the image 
                        of a pair of scales with, for example, two one-
                        pound weights in one pan and, in the other, one 
                        750-gram weight and one 250-gram weight.

                        It is certain that with the correctly 
                        measured dose on either side, we can consider 
                        equilibrium to be established, that is, an 
                        equilibrium that is no longer identical with 
                        symmetry. In order, however, for either side 
                        to be identified with certainty as part and 
                        counterpart, so to speak, surely something 
                        beyond this rather rough comparison is needed. 
                        A local imperative must intervene, one which 
                        cannot be avoided in our assessment. Every 
                        conclusive example goes fundamentally beyond a 
                        loose comparison:

                        Here such a local imperative has intervened, i.e.,

                        The axis AB, overloaded with the heavier 
                        red, has sunk to A and risen to B. Originally 
                        it lay horizontally (a-b). Both these axes, the 
                        original ab and the new AB share a single point 
                        in common, the point C. C is therefore the 
                        pivot. The result of this rotation of the axis 
                        is that red, on the left, is lower than light 
                        red, on the right. Now to compensate, dark red 
                        intervenes and will be in a position to provide 
                        the compensation.

                        Buildings of this kind (like towers) are comparable 
                        to a person standing. As the effort to maintain his or 
                        her balance becomes taxing, the person sits down and 
                        reduces this task by about half. If he or she leans back 
                        against something, then only a remnant of the balancing

                        activity is left, but nevertheless still a 
                        remnant, because someone who has fainted might 
                        fall off a chair in certain circumstances. 
                        This remnant only disappears completely in 
                        the recumbent position. The person becomes a 
                        building block.

                        horizontal, at the cost of the vertical. An 
                        appreciable reduction of tension occurs--an epic 
                        tempo in comparison to the drama of the vertical 
                        character--which naturally does not exclude a 
                        weighing-up on each side. The vertical is always 
                        still there!

                        The weighing-up only stops when the diagonal ceases,

                        I am arriving at the essence of the weight of 
                        pictorial elements. If I ask,

                        "Do you consider this square heavy or light?" As 
                        such, there is no definite answer. For if the 
                        answer were "light!" and I added a second much 
                        smaller square,
                    </p>
                    <figure xml:id="lesson3_fig33"></figure>
                    <p>
                        it would thus immediately invalidate the hasty reply, 
                        for now the square makes an impression of being 
                        considerably heavier. One can now say that the 
                        large square is heavy in comparison with the small 
                        one and that the small one is light in comparison 
                        with the large one. Relativities.

                    <figure xml:id="lesson3_fig34"></figure>
                    <p>
                        Now, however, both these weights can hold their own 
                        against one another. And why? One is lighter in terms 
                        of energy, though much larger, and the other is very 
                        heavy in terms of energy, though small in size.
                    </p>
                <pb/>
                    <p>
                        One cannot decide so lightly which is actually 
                        heavier. In this undecided case, the assumption 
                        of the given equilibrium is intuitively close 
                        at hand, implied in our indecisiveness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The effect of weight is more a question of 
                        quantity on the left, in comparison to the 
                        right, where it expresses itself more qualita- 
                        tively. Relativities!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The assumption that black is heavier than 
                        white only applies as long as we move on the 
                        white plane as a precondition. In this case, 
                        if we disregard color, black is the device for 
                        developing energy. The blacker the energy, the 
                        heavier the impression of weight compared to 
                        the white plane. Again, a relativity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If, by contrast, one takes a black plane 
                        as given, then a black energy cannot therefore 
                        express itself on that plane, precisely because 
                        its weightiest development, deep black, would 
                        not stand out at all. Therefore in this case, 
                        as long as we disregard color, white is the 
                        given energy, and it is precisely the brightest 
                        white that has the qualifications for producing 
                        the heaviest effects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On a gray plane of medium tone, black and 
                        white can rival each other as energies.

                        Outdoors, for example in the countryside, 
                        one may assume a white plane as given if the 
                        weather is foggy. The things that are closest 
                        by (and thus the heaviest) stand out to us  
                        as particularly dark, whereas heading into  
                        the distance everything grows gradually

                        lighter until finally it merges entirely with 
                        the background.

                        In the dark of night, areas of brightness, 
                        such as illuminated windows, have the strongest 
                        and heaviest effect.

                        And on a normal day, one can observe the 
                        interaction of dark and light against a medium 
                        tonality.

                        In physics one speaks of specific weight 
                        in comparison to water. In our case, there 
                        are several specific weights, in comparison to 
                        white, to black, or to the average of the two 
                        (and to every gradation between).

                        After that, the world of colors introduces

                        (figs. 4 and 5) If one compares their 
                        numerical expression, both structures resemble 
                        each other to a tee. The difference lies only 
                        in the choice of means for representing them 
                        pictorially. (fig. 4) The first case makes 
                        use only of the measures "single segment" and 
                        "double segment," while the second case makes 
                        use only of the weights, light and dark. In 
                        other words, measure in one case, weight in the 
                        other. Or, in one case, a force that achieves 
                        the greater output, 2, without a greater effort 
                        but through a doubling of the time in which it 
                        occurs; and in the other, a force that works 
                        towards its greater output only with doubled 
                        energy.

                        Note: I would like to provide a picture frame with a 
                        hook; I measure the upper horizontal very accurately to 
                        find the center. I attach the hook exactly at the midpoint

                    <p>
                        and am convinced that now nothing else is lacking. Yet 
                        in the end, the picture still hangs crooked on the wall.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And why is it hanging crooked? Because the 
                        density of the wood is not uniform or because the glass 
                        is possibly thicker and heavier on one side. In short, I 
                        have made the mistake of measuring instead of weighing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In another case I want to cut a very long wooden 
                        pole into exactly two halves. It seems to me that the 
                        simplest way is to balance the pole on a sharp edge. I 
                        am pleased with my sharp-wittedness and happily saw on. 
                        The result: two pieces of entirely different lengths. Why,  
                        then? The wood must have varied in its thickness and 
                        weight, and I made the mistake of proceeding by weighing 
                        instead of measuring.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, on the one hand, measure; on the other, 
                        weight. I return to both our higher-order structures 
                        and consider the numerical series they share in 
                        common:
                        1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This series does not change if I represent it thus: 
                        (1 + 2)+(1 + 2)+(1 + 2)+(1 + 2), etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This, then, equals:
                        3   +   3   +   3   +   3    And this is the 
                        regular repetition of a type of unit (tripartite), 
                        and therefore again a purely structural case.

                        This algebraic maneuver corresponds pictorially 
                        to the following conception:

                        sided, four-part units with a value of six:
                        6 + 6 + 6       I + I + I

                        (figs. 7a and 8) A variant of the concept of 
                        this chessboard structure with emphasis on the 
                        diagonals offers us a linear structure with two 
                        different qualities of line, which again can be 
                        read reciprocally as the rhythm of four-part units. 
                        These units take the shape of squares standing on 
                        their vertices.

                        And in this way one can invent fascinating 
                        higher-order structural motifs; as soon as any 
                        repeating rhythm can be verified, its structural 
                        character is established.

                        It cannot be claimed that such rhythms are 
                        inherently of an organic character. This is 
                        confirmed at a first glance at the corresponding 
                        numerical series. Every organism is an individuum, 
                        a word meaning "indivisible." That is to say, one 
                        cannot remove anything from it without altering the 
                        character of the whole or, in the case of living 
                        beings, without impairing the function of the whole 
                        or even stopping it outright. Likewise, nor can one 
                        add something to it.

                        Our numerical series and numerical complexes

                        A great advantage, however, also lies in the 
                        individual insignificance of the structural 
                        rhythms: they can be easily arranged into 
                        an organic, individual whole, supporting the 
                        organism's being--without opposing it anywhere.

                        reduced to one or to similar numbers but must 
                        stop inexorably at proportions like 2:3:5 or

                        I now cross over to the domain of music. Here the 
                        bar is the fundamental structure. For the ear, the bar

                        experienced throughout as a structural web on which

                        Inherent to it is the shortcoming that, with just the

                        On such a foundation I can now attempt to represent 
                        pictorially a thematic musical construct, in one or more 
                        voices.

                    <p>
                        I choose two bars from a work in three voices by Bach
                        and examine them microscopically according to the follow-

                        Since music without dynamics sounds mechanical and expression- 
                        less, I choose the qualitative representation, C, and give 
                        the line more or less weight, analogous to the quality of 
                        the tone, while the quantitative representation is expressed 
                        in B in the vertical strokes for bars and parts of bars.

                        With this example (insert, fig. 22), which attempts 
                        to represent, pictorially and objectively, a thing 
                        that is simultaneously abstract and absolutely real, 
                        we can learn quite a few things: first of all, the 
                        possibility of this new representation in itself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        : Furthermore, we can identify the relationship 
                        among the two or three "voices," which pertains to 
                        their place according to length and height;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        : Their relationship among each other, which 
                        pertains to their degree of individualization. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One moment it is two voices, the next it is 
                        three that sound together (and occasionally a single 
                        voice could even sound alone).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Both voices in the first bar (the second and 
                        third voices) differ greatly with regards to their 
                        individualization. The lower voice has a distinctly 
                        structural character in comparison with the higher 
                        voice, which remains individual.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When it enters later, the first voice begins 
                        somewhat lower than the second, seeking to leap over 
                        it, which at first it fails to do. Only after the 
                        short pause in the second voice does the first attain 
                        its coveted predominance. With the individualized 
                        entry of the first voice, the second is demoted to 
                        a structural character; due to its higher position 
                        in agreeable contrast to the third (which at this 
                        point dips slightly), the second voice makes an arc 
                        under which the first voice moves individually.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the yielding pause, the second voice runs 
                        parallel to the third.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The third voice remains true to its structural 
                        character from the beginning up to the point where 
                        the second joins it in parallel; here one can detect 
                        a timid attempt at individuality.

                        A glance at the quantities of the example (insert, 
                        fig. 22) also shows that the mensural differences 
                        are based on simple and adjacent numbers. Were 
                        ratios of very small numbers to very large ones to 
                        occur in this example, then it would be a question

                        The time before last, I established the moment 
                        of repetition as a characteristic of structural 
                        rhythms. With a few structural examples that 
                        were fundamental due to their primitivity, we 
                        obtained, by measuring and weighing, series 
                        like:
                        1  to  1  to  1  to  1  to  1
                        or like  1+2  to  1+2  to  1+2  to  1+2
                        "   " 11+10  to  11+10  to  11+10,
                        for which we substituted the series I to I to I to I,
                        with the Roman numeral one understood as a 
                        compound unit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the realm of two dimensions, in a plane, 
                        instead of these series we obtained complexes 
                        like
                        I  I  I  I
                        I  I  I  I
                        I  I  I  I
                        I  I  I  I
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In contrast to these characters, we considered 
                        individual rhythms, taking as their basis numbers  
                        with which the moment of repetition was precluded. 
                        The prime numbers appeared to be particularly 
                        suited for this: 
                        3 to 5 to 7 to 11 to 13 to 17 to 19 to 23, etc.
                        In the following exercise, "Combination of structural
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        and individual rhythms," I warned against 
                        proceeding mathematically, because the theory 
                        is after all just an ordering of intuitively 
                        available things and plays only a retroactive 
                        role in the creative process--the role of 
                        criticism, brought to bear retroactively.

                        In some cases, an intimate fusion of individuum and 
                        structure was sketched out, the structure obligingly 
                        following the individuum's trail, step by step.

                        Let us assume that fig. 1 represents the 
                        individuum. Proof: no repetition. Like an upbeat it 
                        begins at A with seventeen, plummets by a value of 
                        twenty-three, bends at a wide angle to the right with 
                        thirteen, rises vertically with three, angles left 
                        with two, drops diagonally with nineteen, angles left 
                        <seg><figure xml:id="lesson5_fig2"></figure></seg>with fifteen to 
                        the endpoint Z.
                        (I ask, meanwhile, 
                        that the numbers
                        be understood not 
                        quantitatively, but 
                        qualitatively.) 
                        The result is 
                        three circumscribed 
                        planes of a non
                        repeating, and there

                        (to fig. 2)
                        With fig. 2, the structural character comes into play. 
                        The plummeting vertical divides into five, five times,* 
                        the individual thirteen in a series of threes, followed 
                        by several twos, several threes, sixes, etc.
                        *Pay attention to the points of intersection!

                    <p>
                        Regarding the combined figure (2), it still must be 
                        said that the measures of the individual rhythm are 
                        greater than the measures of the structure and that 
                        the individual (line-)trajectory is qualitative (or 
                        weighing), in comparison to the structure that is 
                        kept purely quantitative (measuring). *Note!

                    <p>
                        In this case (fig. 3) you can speak of a two-voiced 
                        trajectory, in which the individual theme is not 
                        repeatedly intersected by the structural theme, as 
                        in the previous example, but only now and then, not 
                        even in every segment. Consequently, one cannot 
                        deny the structural theme a certain independence. It 
                        is aware of this and takes on a dynamic character 
                        in its trajectory. The individuum feels magnificent 
                        because of its higher distinctiveness, it requires 
                        no special accentuation of its ego, and it goes along 
                        separately, in quantitative stillness, flute-like, in 
                        spite of the companionship of the heavy structural

                        * I recently translated a musical construct into a 
                        pictorial construct. So now I can also think of the 
                        reverse and ask myself, how would our individuum, 
                        with its structure, sound as music? Undoubtedly as 
                        pure melody with purely accompanying subordinate 
                        forms.

                        characters corresponds to the ratios in the first 
                        example (fig. 2). The measures of the individual rhythm 
                        contain the higher numbers.

                        In this new example (fig. 4), if one disregards the verticals,  
                        the structural part may be analyzed very primitively as a re- 
                        peated ratio of 1 to 1 to 1 to 1 to 1 to 1. (horizontal parallels)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The verticals, a bit more developed rhythmically, introduce 
                        something new, namely, alternation in pairs:
                        2a  +  2b  +  2a  +  2b 
                        (vertical alternation)
                        (1+1) (1+1)  (1+1) (1+1) (horizontal parallels)
                        Or, 
                        in sum I to I
                        In this linear representation of the structure, the manner of expression  
                        is purely mensural. If one thinks of the squares in alternating colors,*
                        The individual part of this example shows us several individuums

                    <p>
                        * then one must take into account the fact that different colors  
                        indicate the strongest (psychological) dynamism and that great  
                        restraint is demanded of the individuum.

                        which differ from one another without repetitions. 
                        Where they are articulated, the articulation is based 
                        on individual numbers. Their expression is dynamic 
                        (weighing) in comparison to the purely mensural 
                        manner of expression of the structural part.

                        Comparison of the 3 examples.
                        The first example (fig. 2) was melodic with 
                        structural accompaniment, therefore, a dominant 
                        individuum.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second (fig. 3) was thematic in two voices, 
                        with dynamic accentuation of the relatively structural 
                        part, therefore, a delicate individuum.

                    <p>
                        This third example is a kind of emblem of the 
                        happy individuum or of happy individuums, which are 
                        able to arrange themselves rigorously over a wide 
                        area in conformity with the set structural pattern, 
                        without detracting from their individual character.

                        For a further example I am inspired by a 
                        very lovely little collage on glass that I got to 
                        see in the last exercise (fig. 5).

                        produced a dynamic particularly rich in contrast, ranging 
                        from light to very deep dark, from the way in which 
                        they overlapped, because the light was meant to shine 
                        through it from behind, as with a glass window.

                        In the deep dark tonality, there was already a 
                        transition to the individual. However, the individuum 
                        received its full, most highly dynamic force of 
                        expression through the rhythmization of the squares 
                        into the complexes according to their color type: blue, 
                        red, violet, etc.

                        A highly dynamic individuum arose out of colors

                        the formal terrain of culture. In our constructing, 
                        we worked from terrestrial, human assumptions, 
                        from the way in which we are affixed to the 
                        earth, from our restricted possibilities of 
                        movement, from the limited range of physics.

                        The main symbol of our activity was the pair 
                        of weighing scales, that horizontal governed by 
                        the vertical force of attraction of the ground

                    <p>
                        The simplest symbol for this force of attraction is 
                        the plumbline,  the simple vertical. The weighing 
                        <seg><figure xml:id="lesson5_fig7"></figure></seg>scales, however, take this 
                        perpendicular into account; 
                        the perpendicular is the 
                        criterion for its position 
                        of equilibrium.

                    <p>
                        One could thus say that the spirit of the scales is 
                        this cross:

                        Disruptions of the equilibrium of the scales produce 
                        the diagonal,

                        Now, where does this powerful force of attraction 
                        reside?

                        Or, if you know that this ground as a whole has 
                        the form of a ball, it resides at the center of 
                        this ball, at the center of the earth:

                        As a rule, physically, we cannot avoid this; as 
                        a rule, everything in this world must reckon 
                        with it. In particular, a construction's every 
                        stone is possessed by this force, whether they be 
                        supporting columns or the spans lying over them.

                    <p>
                        So, as a rule, we will repeatedly occupy 
                        ourselves with problems of statics. And our own 
                        physical-human dependence on this terrestrial 
                        force facilitates our ability to draw conclusions 
                        about our fellow sufferer of this force--the 
                        construction, the physical work.

                        In practice, our limited physical size and 
                        range of action compel us to start from the 
                        component, from the part of the whole.

                        That it is our lot to be thus bound should not 
                        discourage us from recognizing that above us, things 
                        can be otherwise, that there are regions where other 
                        laws hold, for which new symbols will have to be 
                        found, corresponding to movement that is looser and 
                        to places that are more mobile.

                        The intermediate realm of the atmosphere, or of

                        it, he can indulge in new possibilities of movement.

                        little to be done. One is left to forces like air 
                        currents or cooler and warmer air. The way in which 
                        air masses of differing temperature flow into one

                        Exercise: Combination of rigid and fluid (or loose) 
                        rhythms. The end result should be the composition. The 
                        tasks from earlier exercises can be incorporated.
                        E.g., applying a rigid rhythm to the individuum, a loose
                        rhythm to the structural;
                        or, applying a [loose] rhythm to the individuum, [rigid] 
                        to the structural; 
                        or, two individuums affecting each other mutually, one

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am beginning today with criticism of an imperfect 
                        solution to the last exercise, but by no means wish 
                        to imply that there were fewer good solutions than 
                        previously. I am likewise reluctant to reprove the 
                        author of the imperfect solution; rather, I would 
                        like to use his error as an opportunity for remarks 
                        from which we may all learn and benefit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The exercise was based upon the previous theoretical 
                        remarks about rigid and loose articulation. It was 
                        called, "Combination of rigidly articulated characters 
                        with loosely articulated characters into an organic 
                        whole (the composition)." 
                    </p>
                    <p> In this regard, I made several suggestions:</p>
                    <p>
                        1)  to treat the rigid articulation individually and 
                        to subordinate the loose articulation in support 
                        of the individuum. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Or, 2)  to dedicate the loose articulation to the 
                        individuum, and (conversely) to keep the rigid 
                        articulation structural.
                    </p>
                <pb/>
                    <p>
                       In music, both ways of treating two characters are 
                        described as melodic (solo voice with accompaniment).
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        Thirdly, I suggested letting both kinds of articu
                        lation struggle for equivalence, which in music is 
                        called thematic treatment.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Or, fourth, treating both types of articulation 
                        as having the same power, so that they would not 
                        struggle against each other but rather, amicably 
                        complementing each other, they would mutually and 
                        alternately grant the upper hand. Once again, an 
                        example of thematic treatment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, a spirited colleague of yours chose 
                        quite simple forms and established a rhythm with 
                        dynamic light and dark accentuation, on the one hand, 
                        with straight lines:
                    </p>
                    <figure xml:id="lesson6_fig1"></figure>
                    <p>and, on the other, with circles:</p>
                    <figure xml:id="lesson6_fig2"></figure>
                    <p>
                        So, are both these characters suitable 
                        examples of rigid and fluid articulation?
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        To begin with the first character,
                        What is this?
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        It is a plane that approaches the  
                        linear in an upright direction,
                        like this <seg><figure xml:id="lesson6_figureA"></figure></seg> or <seg><figure xml:id="lesson6_figureB"></figure></seg> this.

                        <cb n="left"/>
                        And what is 
                        this?
                        <cb n="right"/><seg><figure xml:id="lesson6_fig4"></figure></seg>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is a rigidly articulated expansion and contraction of 
                        a row of planes that approach linearity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The expansion and contraction develops in a hori- 
                        zontal direction, like this <seg><figure xml:id="lesson6_figureC"></figure></seg> or this <seg><figure xml:id="lesson6_figureD"></figure></seg>. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The sense of which can also be represented in the 
                        following manner:
                    </p>
                    <figure xml:id="lesson6_fig5"></figure>
                    <p>
                        The first character (fig. 1) therefore conforms to the 
                        exercise. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But what about the second character? Does the row of 
                        swelling and shrinking circles correspond to the task? 
                    </p>
                    <figure xml:id="lesson6_fig6"></figure>
                    <p>
                        Yes, since the articulation around a common point cannot 
                        be described as rigid, much less when fig. 6 allows for 
                        other interpretations, such as in fig. 7,
                    </p> 
                    <figure xml:id="lesson6_fig7"></figure>
                    <p> or in fig. 8,</p>
                    <figure xml:id="lesson6_fig8"></figure>
                <pb/> 
                    <p>or their variants, 7a and 8a.</p> 
                    <figure xml:id="lesson6_fig7a"></figure>
                    <figure xml:id="lesson6_fig8a"></figure>
                    <p>
                        So the row of circles as a loosely articulated 
                        character also corresponds quite closely to the 
                        proposed task. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, how did both characters behave in relation 
                        to one another in the solution I objected to? 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If, on the one hand, we had an individuum and, 
                        on the other, a structural character, then we could 
                        resort to guessing and try our luck. But here both 
                        characters are developed equally little. I remember 
                        that they behaved like this, 
                    </p>

                        <seg><figure xml:id="lesson6_fig9"></figure></seg>
                        in relation to 
                        each other.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <cb n="left"/> Or, actually, like this:

                        <cb n="right"/>And that means?

                <pb/>
                    <p> Alas, nothing in the sense of the proposed task.</p>
                    <p>
                        In itself, it could well mean something, namely, 
                        either a bipartite or tripartite unit, perhaps an 
                        everyday object like a lamp with a base, globe, and 
                        cylinder,

                        However, the requirement, a "Composition based on

                        except that their fusion into a single thing is not 
                        possible,

                    <p>
                        because <seg><figure xml:id="lesson6_figureE"></figure></seg> or <seg><figure xml:id="lesson6_figureF"></figure></seg> is no organic confrontation

                    <p>
                        between <seg><figure xml:id="lesson6_figureG"></figure></seg> circle and <seg><figure xml:id="lesson6_figureH"></figure></seg> straight line!

                    <p>
                        Nor is the repetition of this motif a solution to 
                        the question!

                    <figure xml:id="lesson6_fig12.0"></figure>
                    <p>
                        So that we may more easily assess this motif by translating 
                        it into a material case, with this construct (fig. 12), for 
                        example, we can imagine a row of pieces of wood of unequal 
                        weight, shaped like piano keys,
                        <seg><figure xml:id="lesson6_figureI"></figure></seg> upon which the tops
                    </p>

                        of tin cans have
                        been placed: <seg><figure xml:id="lesson6_fig13"></figure></seg>
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        In this case, there are no longer unified objects 
                        but rather two material characters without a visible 
                        relationship, merely superimposed, completely 
                        lacking spirit.

                    <p>
                        In short: the <seg><figure xml:id="lesson6_fig14"></figure></seg> relation less ness 
                        of two heterogeneous
                        things:

                    <p>
                        Thus, once again nothing! But what can one do 
                        so that it becomes something?  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So as to continue imagining this in material 
                        terms, let us first of all leave the row of wooden 
                        pieces of different weights at rest where they are, 
                        but instead of the circular planes made of tin, 
                        atop the wooden pieces we will place a bull's-eye 
                        of crown glass or optical lenses or glass spheres.
                        And,  visibly, something will occur, 
                        namely, the pic- <seg><figure xml:id="lesson6_figureL"></figure></seg> -torial expression of 
                        the relationship between two hetero-
                        geneous things.

                        The struggle of the aggressive straight line against 
                        the inherently quiescent circle, and the defeat of the 
                        straight line when it falls within the dangerous region 
                        of its partner. Struggle at the expense of the straight

                        The following example teaches us another way 
                        pictorially to express the relationship between two 
                        heterogeneous things (fig. 18 and following):

                        The straight line applies sharpness of the most aggres-

                        out its struggle at the expense of the circle. The 
                        circle has visibly succumbed (figs. 18 and 19).

                        Further examples would not contribute anything 
                        essentially new, so I shall limit myself to these 
                        few. Depending on the spirit of the emerging 
                        composition, I shall choose one of these typical 
                        motifs or the other and will have a configuration 
                        of struggle or of friendship. The struggle can be 
                        carried out with varying sharpness; friendship can 
                        be based on unilateral or mutual adaptation.

                        The interpretation of the constructive process 
                        can be even richer in relationships if I designate 
                        the straight line as masculine, on account of 
                        its spontaneous activity, and if, conversely, I 
                        designate the circle as feminine in its inherent 
                        quiescence.

                        Now, in our example that provided the occasion for 
                        this criticism, however, the motifs we have just 
                        discussed in terms of the extended compositional

                        My previous discussions of the structural concept 
                        dealt with the most primitive structural type based on 
                        repeating rhythms.

                    <p>
                        In the practical exercises, however, a structural 
                        element often appeared that rose above this primitivity. 
                        I found no reason to object to a structural element 
                        of this kind as long as a higher development stood 
                        against it or rested above it, qua individuum.

                        The science of anatomy teaches us, usually by way 
                        of introduction, to recognize in their structure the 
                        matter from which plants or animals are constructed. 
                        A knife is used for this purpose. This science 
                        understands structure as the grouping of the smallest 
                        corpuscles of matter that are visible with the naked 
                        eye or a microscope.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Matter that, for example, has undergone the ravages 
                        of erosion offers similar structural images.

                        In any case, one can perhaps even detect with the 
                        naked eye the rhythm of the corpuscles in a bone, the 
                        result of which is a multitude of cavities akin to 
                        cells* or tubes or channels.

                        In a similar fashion, one can detect the structure

                        The ligaments connect 
                        several bones, they 
                        serve the bones, their 
                        function is subordinate,

                    <p>
                        Therefore, in arranging the 
                        schema of action, I will allow the  
                        ligament only a little space, but 
                        somewhat more space for the bone:

                    <p>
                        If I consider the relationship of bone to muscle 
                        with regard to the movement-organism, 
                    </p>

                        <cb n="left"/>
                        B bone
                        T tendon
                        M muscle

                        <cb n="right"/>
                        then I recognize that 
                        here the tendon carries 
                        out a similar mediating 
                        function as did the 
                        ligament previously, 
                        in the way in which the 
                        tendon joins the muscle 
                        to the bone (fig. 32).
                    </p>
                    <p>And how does the muscle relate to the bone?</p>
                    <figure>
                        <figure xml:id="lesson6_fig33"></figure>
                        <figure xml:id="lesson6_fig33a"></figure>

                    <p>
                        It can force the bone into a new position, since 
                        the muscle has the ability to contract and, in the 
                        process, to shorten itself. And, at the same time, 
                        tendons and ligaments help by tenaciously holding 
                        tight. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The angle between two bones must change because the 
                        muscle wills it. The muscle's function of movement
                    </p>
                <pb/> 
                    <p>
                        is therefore of a higher order than the bones' 
                        function of movement. The passivity of the bone 
                        depends on the activity of the muscle. The function 
                        of the bone is functional-structural in relation 
                        to the function of the muscle. It helps the muscle 
                        translate the movement-command (wherever it comes 
                        from) into action.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Therefore, in my schema of the action of 
                        movement, I allow a larger space for the muscle, 
                        and leave the tendon to mediate between them.  
                    </p>
                    <figure xml:id="lesson6_fig34"></figure>
                    <p>
                        The muscles perform mutually independent functions.
                    </p>
                <pb/> 
                    <p>
                        Each muscle has a specific task; one bends the 
                        organ, the other stretches it, etc. Here, too, we 
                        observe functioning of a higher order than that of 
                        the bone, which can achieve nothing by itself but 
                        only in conjunction with a second bone. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But since we have already mentioned the word 
                        "movement-command," the muscle's active self-mastery 
                        extends only so far. It obeys as soon as the command 
                        reaches it; it does not want to act but must act; at 
                        most it wants to obey.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It obeys the brain's command, transmitted 
                        telegraphically by the nerve cord.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our schema of the action of movement is again 
                        expanded:  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        What do we learn (from fig. 35)? We recognize, first  
                        of all, the relativity of serving and governing, of 
                        structural and individual functioning: as a whole, a 
                        nested structure (a box in a box in a box).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The progression of the functional values goes 
                        according to spatial or quantitative points of view: 
                        "That which is greater requires more room." The direc- 
                        tion is eccentric. Higher values withdraw further 
                        and further from the central point; the significance 
                        increases as we go from the center away towards the 
                        periphery.

                        The notional passageway whose point of origin is 
                        the brain--and which confers a central significance 
                        and quality on this organ and allows it to transmit 
                        commands in every direction--would lead us to an 
                        inverse, concentric representation, or a qualitative 
                        representation.

                    </p>
                    <p> The exercise from the last meeting was:</p>
                    <p>
                        Tripartite organism;
                        First organ, active character (brain)
                        Second organ, medial character (muscle)
                        Third organ, passive character (bone)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Brain, muscle and bone were not to be represented 
                        as such but rather were to be understood schematically, 
                        in view of their position within the animal movement
                        organism that I had discussed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The concepts of active, medial, and passive can be 
                        best explained in philological or linguistic terms:
                        If I say, "I impel," it is an active form.
                        If I say, "I am impelled," it is the linguistic expres- 
                        sion of the passive.
                        But the expression of the medial form would be: 
                        I integrate myself, I fit myself in, 
                        I make friends of myself. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is also worth noting that the ancient languages 
                        of the civilized nations could form the passive voice 
                        without an auxiliary verb, purely morphologically, 
                        by means of a particular verb ending. I still even 
                        remember the pure medial form in Greek, expressed 
                        only in the verb ending, with no pronoun whatsoever. 
                        The modern languages no longer convey these three 
                        characters by means of purely synthetic verbal forms, 
                        using for this purpose instead several roundabout 
                        combinations of words.  
                    </p>
                    <p>As for the rank of these three characters, active,</p>
                <pb/> 
                    <p>
                        medial, and passive, it will depend on different 
                        points of view.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Conceptually, the active would be classified as 
                        principal, because the impulse to move starts in the 
                        brain, because in it resides thought, the father of 
                        all more highly developed action.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From the material point of view, the order would 
                        be the inverse, and we would say that the rigid 
                        matter, the bone, first realizes the movement and 
                        that it belongs in first place. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is not necessary to set the two points of view 
                        against each other. What is essential is the organically 
                        shared unity of the three as left, center, and right 
                        organs or as right, center, and left organs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Considering the particular difficulty of the 
                        exercise I counted myself satisfied with solutions 
                        whose organic coherence was plainly evident,
                        on the one hand, in the form of the organs
                        themselves,
                        on the other, in the emphasis given in this form's
                        representation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First example: the water mill <seg><figure xml:id="lesson7_fig1"></figure></seg>
                        principal organ: the water 
                        other organs:  two wheels,one large and one 
                        small, connected by a drive-belt.
                        Criticism:  a) Formal error in the choice of 
                        the lower organs, because in the 
                        relationship of significance to 
                        the principal organ, there is 
                        no stepwise organic tripartite 
                        division.
                        b) Formal error in the shape of 
                        the main organ; its form is at best a

                        conventional undulating structure just the way you 
                        "do water," but not an outstanding configuration of 
                        a main organ.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        c) Error of emphasis: the principal organ, water, 
                        is treated too lightly in dynamic terms.

                        b) Relationally correct formation of organs: The 
                        principal organ is articulated with the greatest 
                        individuality; the others are articulated decreasingly 
                        so, by steps.

                    <p>
                        c) Relationally correct emphasis of organs: I. with 
                        principal energy, II. with medium energy, III. with 
                        negligible energy.

                        As a result, as far as configuration and emphasis are

                        (Example one A):
                        With the choice of organs, I can expand 
                        the failed example (fig. 1) upwards as well, instead 
                        of downwards (as was the case when the hammer 
                        was added). So we remove the hammer, the wheel 
                        becomes III, the water becomes II, and I shall 
                        think of something new for I. This proves easier, 
                        since flowing water does not yet correspond to any 
                        originating initiative.

                        We are familiar with the earth's force of gravity

                        just as we are familiar with the horizontal

                        Without the mountains A and B hemming it in, the water 
                        would drain off on both sides:

                    <p>
                        If we remove mountain B and leave mountain A standing, 
                        then the water only flows off to the right. As a 
                        result, two forces are at work, first gravity, second 
                        the obstructing mountain (fig. 7).

                        serves the purposes of reproduction.
                        Here, in that case, one could perhaps 
                        claim the following as characteristic 
                        for our tripartite order:
                        as I: stamen and pollen,
                        as II: the mediation of insects,
                        as III: the fertilized seeds.

                    <p>Third example: circulation</p>
                    <p>
                       We could broaden our studies of nature in the field 
                        of anatomy yet further, from the realm of voluntary 
                        movement to that of involuntary movement. 
                    </p>

                    <p> 
                        Voluntary movement occurs, as the expression 
                        indicates, following a command, according to the 
                        requirements of the authority we commonly call the 
                        brain. It hardly ever applies to the entire movement 
                        apparatus, but rather sets merely partial couplings 
                        into action. This part of the animal movement-machine 
                        is subject to fatigue; the norm here is fatigue, 
                        sluggishness, and, when called for, suspension (in 
                        sleep).

                        The involuntary movements of the other part of the 
                        machine: of the heart, of the lungs, of the digestive 
                        and excretive systems. These involuntary movements do 
                        not cease during a lifetime. Here fatigue, sluggishness, 
                        and missing a beat are not allowed for.

                        All this as a postscript to our last exercise... 
                        The schematic concision of my presentation has probably 
                        been evident to you; on the one hand it clarifies 
                        matters plainly while, on the other, it leaves open to 
                        you the most diverse ways of configuring the formal 
                        concepts and relationships we have examined.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, in order to configure formal relationships 
                        of this type (made even more specific in our exercise), 
                        namely, movement (in our special case, movement that is 
                        elicited, transmitted, and compelled)--in order to let 
                        the relationships of movement, on the basis of analytic 
                        abstraction, return to their nature, to the work's 
                        own nature--for that purpose, we shall still require 
                        something beyond a clearly thought-out schema.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What does movement in the work actually mean? As a 
                        rule, after all, our works won't be moving, will they? 
                        We are, after all, not an automaton factory!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        No, most of our works will, of their own accord, 
                        remain at rest in their place. Yet, nevertheless, they 
                        are wholly movement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Movement is proper to all becoming, and before the 
                        work is, the work becomes, just like the world. Before 
                        it was--according to the quotation, "in the beginning 
                        God created..."--it became; and furthermore, it becomes 
                        before in the future it is.

                    <p>
                        The work becomes: stone upon stone or, from the 
                        block, piece from piece.

                    <p>
                        That is the initial productive-movement, the 
                        beginning action of the one who is creating. This 
                        beginning action is already of a temporal nature, 
                        whether it remains flat or results in a volume: this 
                        takes time. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Shortly after this initial productive-movement, 
                        the first counter-movement already begins with the 
                        creator: the initial receptive-movement. Or, in 
                        everyday language, he inspects what he has made up to 
                        this point. ("...And he saw that it was good," as it 
                        is written.)

                    <p>
                        Once again, a temporal process. Only the tiniest  
                        thing of all--the point, dead unto itself--is timeless.  
                        As soon as this point becomes movement and line, it 
                        requires time, in the same way as when this line is 
                        pushed to produce a plane or when the movement of 
                        planes produces volumes. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From a cosmic standpoint, movement is actually a 
                        given, and as an infinite force it requires no special 
                        energetic impetus. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The inhibition, by matter, of this given 
                        movement results in the quiescence of things in the 
                        earthly sphere. It is misguided to assume that this 
                        adhesion to the earth is the norm.

                        The history of the work, which is first and 
                        foremost genesis, can be described briefly in broad 
                        strokes as a hidden spark from somewhere that, 
                        glowing, ignites the human spirit, moves the human 
                        hand and from there is transmitted as movement of 
                        matter; it becomes work.

                        The receptive process is equivalent. The beholder (who 
                        can be the same as the creator) goes, so to speak, in the 
                        opposite direction. But the beholder, too, is completely 
                        moved in time.

                        equal intensity. It lacks the physical capacity to do so, 
                        because the retina does not perceive the entire image

                        of the lens and with the center of visual acuity on the

                        the object, then it must turn upwards. If it wishes to 
                        perceive section III sharply, then it must be lowered.

                    <p>
                        Eye muscles turn the eye here and there--from left to 
                        right, from corner to corner, around in a circle--and 
                        the sections it sees sharply, one after the other, are 
                        gradually registered in the brain to create an overall 
                        impression. The brain has the capacity to store memory 
                        images and to assemble them into a whole; the eye has the 
                        ability to visit a spot over and over again to inspect 
                        and consolidate.

                    <p>
                        We know full well that the image in the eye is actually inverted, 
                        but this alters essentially nothing at all in the process.

                       Stage I: The beholder perceives the central section, I. 
                        Sections II and III lack sharpness on the retina. The 
                        muscles for lowering and raising the eye are not involved.

                    <p>
                        Stage II: The beholder's eye now 
                        obeys the desire to examine the upper 
                        region clearly. The lower muscle
                        muscle for raising contracts

                    <p>
                        becomes active, contracting until it brings the eye into 
                        the new position where the area of acuity on the retina, 
                        the focal point of the lens, and area II of the object 
                        lie in a straight line.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Area I is still perceived but less sharply, while 
                        III, which was previously still perceptible though 
                        without clarity, leaves the field of vision.

                    <p>
                        Stage III (fig.17): The eye should obey the beholder's 
                        desire to perceive the lower region in full sharpness. 
                        For this purpose the muscle for lowering the eye is 
                        able to contract, and the eye follows effortlessly, 
                        until the retina's center of visual acuity, the focal 
                        point of the lens, and part III of the object lie in 
                        a straight line. Thus, I remains visible (though not 
                        sharply), while II leaves the field of vision.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this way the eye, like a grazing animal, scans 
                        a plane not only from bottom to top, but also from 
                        left to right and in every direction, where it has 
                        reason to do so.

                        attract it later, once the first values have been grazed

                        then the eye moves more in leaps and bounds, in the

                        to this current like a little boat, or it sails like a 
                        cloud in lightly or stormily moving winds (fig. 20).

                        We learn: The movement-function of a work need not 
                        be emphasized as such. For as you have seen, the most 
                        quiescent and stable work is also movement.

                        is very much alive. This can lead us to new, richer

                    <p>
                        The function of a visual work is the way in which 
                        the work's construction, set in motion over time,
                        communicates itself to the eye and the way in which 
                        the character of movement inherent in each work is 
                        imposed upon the eye and upon the powers of reception 
                        lying behind it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here we touch upon the old story of effect, 
                        but through emphasis on the character of movement 
                        inherent in each visual work, not the effect 
                        generally, the effect per se, but the kind of effect 
                        particular to each case.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To differentiate these kinds of effects by classi- 
                        fying them amounts to classifying the types of works.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As we saw last time, every work, even 
                        the most concise, moves within time both as it 
                        emerges (productively) and as it is apprehended 
                        (receptively). Our eye is constructed in such a 
                        way that it scans, over time, all that we perceive 
                        visually.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The eye, wearied of familiar nature or 
                        familiar culture, steers towards new, stimulating 
                        peculiarities. Should it fall to a visual work to 
                        exert such stimuli, then the eye steers towards that 
                        area where, as the greatest force of attraction, 
                        the strongest unfolding of pictorial energy asserts 
                        itself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Such a stimulus is always of a relative 
                        nature. If, on a white plane× that has made the 
                        eye curious, an especially deep black is produced 
                        somewhere, then this black in comparison with that 
                        white is a quite strong energy.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Or when on a green plane enticing closer
                        examination,
                    </p>
                    <p> × my sheet of paper on the blackboard</p>
                <pb/> 
                    <p>
                        a sharply contrasting red asserts itself, then this 
                        time the red is the special energy. The same applies 
                        to white on black, warm on cool, lively on calm, and 
                        vice versa, higher on lower, stronger on weaker, 
                        harder on softer. Or active on static, and all the 
                        other opposites that, once created, have the power 
                        to wrest the eye towards themselves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With the feeling (which was somewhat reinforced 
                        by the last exercise), with the feeling, that the 
                        explanations from last time were not yet clear 
                        enough, and in order to be able to build more 
                        securely on them, I am going to backtrack a little.

                        To demonstrate again for you how both the product 
                        and the recept move in time, I will choose as my 
                        product the most concise construct that cannot emerge 
                        at a single stroke (not even one produced with single 
                        strokes from each of two hands at once):

                        A construct that consists of the factors "first," 
                        "second," and "third." This product was not created 
                        in a single stroke but rather took its time; nor

                        <seg><figure xml:id="lesson8_figureD"></figure></seg> There [fig. 1] the planes are to be thought of as 
                        active planes and here [fig. 2] as active lines, which are 
                        not (mind you!) mutually dependent on one another in the way 
                        they were represented earlier, i.e., as here: <seg><figure xml:id="lesson8_figureF"></figure></seg> where the 
                        passive lines depend on the active plane, or here: <seg><figure xml:id="lesson8_figureG"></figure></seg> where 
                        the plane, as opposed to the lines, is the result and is

                        Therefore: there, active planes and, here, active lines 
                        that are functionally linked with each other.

                        Closer examination of the reception image reveals a 
                        movement gradually retreating from the base of the 
                        force, or a gradually weaker valuation compared with 
                        the fundamental principal value. Sequential order and 
                        ranking order coincide.

                        These red forms of diminishing force are the expression  
                        of the function of the three values of our production 
                        image (fig. 1). At the same time, the new form is 
                        itself again an image and indeed an image with pure 
                        movement-form.

                        We will make this last experience even clearer yet

                        This new product consists of nine graded values that, for sim-  
                        plicity's sake, I represent only with quantitative differences. 
                        Language and function would of course find even more vivid 
                        expression with gradations based on tone value or color value.

                        For the purpose of configuring the reception, the 
                        centric character of this product leads me to schematize the 
                        gradation of values in the form of nine circles that recede 
                        further and further from the center.

                        And, with that, the schema in which  
                        the action of reception is to be played  
                        out has been prepared.

                    <p>
                        Before approaching the product, let us envision the 
                        following little prelude: We have moved about, getting 
                        our exercise for some time in the countryside and are 
                        satisfied and tired after our plein-air impressions, 
                        so that coming back into the dark house feels like a 
                        relief. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The room in which we now find ourselves is 
                        completely black, empty and black. The next room that we 
                        enter is also black with the exception of one painted 
                        wall.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here our thoroughly stimulated eye now pounces on 
                        the pure white note, which I have labeled "first." Then 
                        to the still very light note labeled "second," and next 
                        it proceeds to the remaining values, in increasingly 
                        darker gradations.
                    </p>
                    <figure xml:id="lesson8_fig6"></figure>

                    <p>
                        Thus, the path via the separate stimulus-points arranges 
                        itself in the form of a spiral around the white in the 
                        center. The stimulus-points recede ever further from the 
                        center, while maintaining their relatedness to it.
                    </p>
                    <figure xml:id="lesson8_fig7"></figure>
                    <p>
                        The product (fig. 4) consisted of solemnly stable and 
                        quiescent forms. Its recept, the function of this stably 
                        formed construct, is the purest movement-form conceivable, a 
                        spiral. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And so, with every further attempt to represent the 
                        functions of a visual work, we will obtain movement-forms 
                        again and again; the further we advance towards the essence 
                        of the function, the purer the movement-forms.

                        This new product shows, in contrast to before, a now 
                        more erratic arrangement of the values. The preceding 
                        pastorale of the grazing cattle has become the range of 
                        the hunting predator, as will be clearly shown in the 
                        corresponding form of the function.

                        As the first schema to represent this function, to start 
                        with I choose a more epic system (to be read from left 
                        to right) and note on it the values corresponding to the 
                        leaps in value in the product, not in order of rank, but

                        For the second schema, I 
                        choose one that is more 
                        dramatic, with high values 
                        in the middle, therefore 
                        one organized centrally, 
                        and I group values in the 
                        product according to their 
                        proximity to the center: 
                        first (center), eighth, 
                        fifth, ninth, fourth,

                        to the positions of values in the product, and, by connecting 
                        according to rank, I obtain two different recepts that 
                        naturally resemble each other internally to a hair.

                        Having arrived at the dynamic form, we first

                        The movement of a formal element that leads to the 
                        creation of a new formal element need not also produce 
                        a dynamic form. The movement of a point into the mathe

                        indeed a movement-action but not a movement-form. This

                        not a dynamic line because it 
                        is no longer a line at all but 
                        a plane. However, even the

                        plane thus generated (through the line's movement-action) 
                        still need not present a dynamic character as a plane.
                        A visible state of dynamism first arises from gradual 
                        growth or diminution with regard to the quantity or 
                        quality of the energy applied.

                        You will recall the role of the weighing scales,
                        when we were still stable and static and were weighing 
                        the values against each other on either side. What are the 
                        scales to us now in the measurement of dynamic values? 
                        How shall we weigh things that don't keep still?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But perhaps the following bit of imagining has something 
                        calming in itself:

                        This little building is supposed to stand on very small 
                        feet! That won't be very easy. So get the scales over 
                        here, and make that the gold-weighing scales. The weights 
                        tally up: 4 + 1 = 2 + 3. But in practice the thing still 
                        looks rather dubious.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What to do? Let us empathize with it--we who, after 
                        all, are ourselves buildings standing on small feet 
                        and who must not fall down. What do we do in order 
                        not to fall? What do we do when we have not succeeded 
                        in establishing the calm of stasis through a counter
                        balancing shift (on a small scale) of our weighted parts?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First we move a leg (enlargement of the base) and 
                        perhaps the other soon afterwards. And finally we walk; 
                        that makes balancing easier.
                    </p>
                <pb/>
                    <p>We have become a dynamic form and sense relief.</p>
                    <p>
                        And our little building on a small foot? It can't 
                        walk, can it?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It can't walk but perhaps another kind of movement 
                        suits it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's not enlarge its base but, instead, let us 
                        place it on a point and set it swinging vigorously in 
                        motion about itself.

                    <p>
                        Then it's called a top, the top that every child knows 
                        does not fall as long as the motion lasts, as long as 
                        the top spins. Just as calming for us can be a rolling 
                        wheel, the boy's hoop, or even the spinning diabolo, 
                        which understands the art of dancing on the high wire.

                        With in principle such calming thoughts,  we will keep 
                        looking for a replacement for the now  "obsolete" 
                        weighing scales.

                        The pendulum is a very ingenious   little instrument 
                        consisting of a small lead weight, w, and a line, 
                        which swings back and forth from a fixed point, p, 
                        the center; the line, as radius, moves with the weight.

                    <p>
                        The concept of back and forth is essential here, 
                        i.e., the property of the pendulum that consists in 
                        immediately describing the corresponding counter
                        motion to each motion.

                        This one case of the compensatory unification of 
                        motion and counter-motion is, however, not the only 
                        possibility. We can think of a less machine-like 
                        handling, even a very sensitive manual one.

                    <p>
                        Let us take a very long line × and guide the weight with 
                        appreciable slackness.

                        Handled this way, 
                        the lead describes 
                        both motion and 
                        counter-motion 
                        independently.

                    <p>
                        We can proceed yet further from the slackened manual 
                        handling to the sentimental journey of the central 
                        point, p, and the pendulum-script will become the 
                        transcribed expression of the particular form of that 
                        journey.  
                    </p> 
                    <figure xml:id="lesson8_fig19"></figure>
                    <p>
                        Here, for example, the pendulum-script is the dynamic 
                        expression of the vertical straight line, and we arrive 
                        at a dynamic variation on the static construction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Furthermore, we could guide the straight form of 
                        the journey dynamically, along a meandering path, or we 
                        could wander in any form we like.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Or we could complete the slackening of the line 
                        at the right moment by letting it go, and the pendulum 
                        becomes a gentle sling, writing in this way, and, like 
                        the counter-motions of the fixed pendulum, the slingshot 
                        counter-motion is easy to understand and complete.

                    <p>
                        However, a new phenomenon occurs if, once more allowing 
                        the pendulum to swing quite calmly to and fro, we think 
                        of the force of gravity being abolished suddenly in the 
                        middle of an oscillation (fig. 20), or if we lend the 
                        swing so much force that gravity is defeated.   
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        In this way, with the pendulum no longer bound to the 
                        earth, the cosmic movement-form suddenly arises:

                    <figure xml:id="lesson8_fig20"></figure>
                    <p>
                        In this closed, endless motion the need for a counter
                        motion ceases, and indeed the pendulum renounces the 
                        counter-motion in the new circumstances.

                    <p>
                        As opposed to the previous force, which I called 
                        the force of gravity, we now become acquainted with a 
                        new force that I call centrifugal force.

                        New journeys are conceivable with the circling 
                        pendulum, too, if the center is set in motion or 
                        if movement starts with the radius being either 
                        lengthened, upon which ever wider circles sweep out, or 
                        shortened, upon which the circles grow ever tighter, 
                        until the lovely spectacle dies with a jerk, in the 
                        point.

                        The latter is the story of the spiral. Its movement 
                        is no longer endless, inherently quiescent, and so 
                        the question of direction of motion is raised. We must 
                        know this direction because the question dependent on 
                        the lengthening or shortening of the radius (fig. 22a) 
                        is essentially psychic. It runs: Do I loosen myself 
                        from the center in ever freer movement? Or will my

                        The arrow is a projectile precisely formed with 
                        regard to duration and direction of force. Even the 
                        simplest weapon is seized out of the need to extend 
                        our limited physical reach, e.g., the cudgel, 
                        which extends the arm and increases the force of 
                        its swing, leading to firm contact with the target 
                        and fulfilling the will to reach this out-of-range 
                        target without loss of time or other advantages. 
                        From the place just where I stand, without going up 
                        close, with the cudgel I can hit a target that I 
                        couldn't have reached without a weapon.

                        A cast stone is an even more effective device in 
                        this respect. It hits its target while obviating 
                        the need for direct, firm contact; it arrives 
                        through the air at the object over there. In order 
                        to reach this object with some effectiveness, it 
                        needs force and direction during its brief journey: 
                        direction up to the point of contact, and force 
                        over and above.

                        excessive effort required in throwing led to the 
                        perfection of the handling of projectiles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond a doubt such perfection in the sense of 
                        energy reduction led to the invention of the sling.

                        I remember as boys we would cut hazel switches 
                        and then get ourselves some "missiles" out of the 
                        nearby potato field. We speared these missiles in the 
                        form of potatoes firmly onto the thin sticks and set 
                        the apparatus going centrifugally, increasing the 
                        impetus to the point where the missile loosed itself 
                        from the switch.
                    </p>
                    <figure xml:id="lesson9_fig2"></figure>
                    <p>
                        The effect was of course astonishingly great. We did 
                        not need to make complete swings of the arm as when 
                        throwing the stone; this work was taken over from us 
                        for the most part by the sling. Instead, energetic 
                        movements of the wrist, briefly involving the forearm 
                        at the very end, were enough.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       The considerable energy saved was an evident 
                        improvement, for the potato whizzed over several 
                        houses, much farther than ten or twenty carefully 
                        aimed stone-throws put together. And one remained 
                        quite fresh. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But the accuracy remained questionable, and we 
                        secretly admired the achievement of the shepherd 
                        David, who hit Goliath in the middle of his 
                        undoubtedly not very big forehead.
                    </p>
                    <p> The accuracy was therefore not only in need of </p>

                    <p>
                        correction but also capable of being corrected. We made 
                        this discovery en route to the elastic slingshot.

                        This time we cut forked branches from the thicket

                        and attached highly stretchable rubber bands to the ends

                        of the fork; when fired, the bands gave the projectile 
                        no less force and allowed its direction to be controlled. 
                        Accuracy was also increased by changing the missile from 
                        a stone to a kind of arrow, which one could fashion out 
                        of a hairpin. <seg><figure xml:id="lesson9_figureB"></figure></seg>

                        A little pennant made of colored wool served as a

                        Reduction of the energy required and improvement of 
                        aim were achieved. Both factors decisively influenced 
                        not only the whole little gadget but also the shaping 
                        of the projectile, which, first of all because of its 
                        length, experienced little friction and then, because 
                        it was long and straight, made aiming considerably 
                        easier and maintained the chosen direction as well.

                        for holding the drawn string and a trigger, is called 
                        a crossbow. One's body is relieved of all possible 
                        strain, enabling concentration on aiming.

                        linked to it. It would have been easy to hit the mark 
                        with this superior instrument were it not for this

                        The modern firearm, for its part, harks all the 
                        way back to the blowgun, with which every boy is also 
                        familiar. But as regards the arrow, which is here 
                        atavistically still called the ball, the modern 
                        firearm brings in an essential novelty: its two
                        dimensional movement.

                        The dynamic rifling inside the gun barrel imparts a

                        One could call this modern projectile a screwing 
                        arrow, or drilling arrow, because this two-dimensional 
                        forward movement is reminiscent of screws and drills.

                        The father of all mobile or thrown projectiles, so 
                        also of the arrow, was the thought: How can I extend 
                        my reach to over there? Across that river, that lake? 
                        Over that mountain?

                        To over there?
                        Common to this father and to all of his sons are both 
                        the linearity of the movement and the length of its path 
                        in relation to the body of the projectile.

                    <p>
                        The father is all spirit, all idea, indeed all thought. 
                        His movement can be mathematically straight, unaffected 
                        by obstacles, frictionless because bodiless, unrestricted 
                        as to length, finite or infinite.

                        This capacity of human beings to traverse the earthly 
                        and celestial realms at will by means of the mind, in 
                        contrast to their physical powerlessness, is the original 
                        human tragedy. The tragedy of the mind.

                        The consequence of this simultaneous powerlessness 
                        of the body and simultaneous mobility of the mind is 
                        the dichotomy of human existence. Half-shackled, half
                        winged: each of the two parts, through the perception of 
                        its counterpart, becomes conscious of the tragedy of its 
                        halfness.

                        The farther the journey from here to there, the heavier 
                        the tragedy. It is certainly founded, however, on the 
                        very fact of the point of departure, on the necessity 
                        of having to free oneself from a constraint, of having 
                        to become movement and of not being movement already. 
                        So the tragedy is there in the beginning.

                        The trajectory responds to: How does the arrow 
                        overcome frictional drag? Will the movement continue 
                        (till over there, where under no circumstances will 
                        it become infinite), but at least till over there? A

                        A genuine African arrow consists of shaft, tip, and 
                        rudder, like so. The tip must not only cut through 
                        the air as sharply as possible but also pierce the 
                        target as deeply as possible and stick there as firmly 
                        as possible by means of barbs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The rudder of such an arrow serves to reinforce the 
                        direction of the shaft and make maintaining the flight 
                        path easier.

                        Our symbolic arrow differs to some extent from the 
                        African arrow. The concept "path" applies here to the 
                        shaft, and the concept "steering of the tip" applies to 
                        the tip, whereby the rudder on the end of the African 
                        arrow becomes redundant.

                        Unequal length and angle of the lines of the tip

                        This is grounded on the rule of the parallelogram of 
                        forces and manifests itself quite nicely in its one part 
                        that refers to direction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Two cooperating forces a and b, pointing in different 
                        directions, result in a new force c, which proves to 
                        be the diagonal of the parallelogram formed by the two 
                        forces a and b.

                    <p>
                        So: If both tip-rudder forces are equal in relation 
                        to the horizontal, the path remains horizontal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If both tip-rudder forces are unequal in relation 
                        to the horizontal, the path is turned aside by the 
                        tip-rudder force that exhibits the greater deviation 
                        from the horizontal.

                        The stronger the upward-steering force, the higher 
                        the path climbs; the stronger the downward-steering 
                        force, the more the path falls; and in earthly reality 
                        this latter case will always arise after a certain 
                        time, when the earth's force of attraction, with a 
                        gradual drop in speed resulting from drag or friction, 
                    </p>
                <pb/> 
                    <p>
                        confers more and more predominance on the downward
                        steering force.

                        Thus the earthly curve presents itself as finite

                        withdraws from the 
                        earth, presents itself 
                        as infinite movement, 
                        i.e., inasmuch as it 
                        turns into a circle 
                        or at least into an 
                        ellipse.

                        Even at these heights developments are still 
                        conceivable, even if one knows nothing of the dynamic 
                        paths of the stars.

                    <p>
                        One can think of such a circling as an increasing 
                        screw motion,

                    <p>
                        If, however, one thinks conversely of a circling 
                        star approaching another, stronger star too closely, 
                        so that its orbit is drawn ever tighter, then we 
                        arrive symbolically at the motion-antagonistic 
                        spiral, the death-spiral, in which the curve of 
                        the movement becomes tighter and tighter, which 
                        perilously leads to nothingness.

                    <p>
                        The perilous aspect of this mental image is 
                        the alarming rhythmic acceleration towards the end. 
                        With the steering of the arrow, the concentric side 
                        heads more and more towards catastrophe.

                        Anyone who wants to experience this should imagine 
                        rolling like a ball inside a funnel under centrifugal 
                        force in ever tighter curves and in ever accelerating 
                        rhythms towards the bottom of the funnel, towards the 
                        dead center.

                        No rescue; unless a door opens somewhere, 
                        unless somewhere a new force of a repelling or 
                        attracting nature makes itself felt, as here:

                        as here where through the arrival of a new force the 
                        prevalence of the concentric steering is superseded 
                        by the prevalence of the eccentric.

                    <p>
                        Holding this process in our mind's eye, we 
                        proceed from the symbol to the compositional schema:

                    <p>
                        As you see, I distinguish between cause and 
                        effect. Analytically, I schematize the concentric 
                        forces, A1 and A2, and the eccentric force, B, as 
                        causes; and, synthetically, I schematize the motion
                        negative spiral as effect A, with its emergency exit 
                        as effect B.

                    <p>
                        I must begin by saying that considered by 
                        itself, in minimal terms, the arrow was already in 
                        itself a synthesis of cause and effect. The two side
                        rudders, <seg><figure xml:id="lesson9_figureN"></figure></seg>  or the two sides of the parallelogram 
                        of the direction of forces, could  
                        be considered directional causes,

                        the resultant diagonal of the parallelogram of the 
                        <seg><figure xml:id="lesson9_figureO"></figure></seg> direction of forces could be seen as 
                        depending on them, and specifically as a 
                        directional effect.

                    <p>
                        A new relation of the concepts C[ause] and E[ffect] 
                        now arises, as soon as we tackle the compositional 
                        synthesis of C and E within the whole process.

                        Then, seen more broadly, the concentric 
                        forces, A1 and A2, those forces which would like 
                        to lead the spiral movement ad absurdum to a 
                        center point, c, are to be identified as (motion
                        antagonistic) causes; and the motion-rescuing force, 
                        B, is to be identified as a new additional cause; 
                        while, vis-à-vis these causes, the path of the 
                        deflected spiral arrow is only effect (EA1, EA2, and EB).

                        One of the first movement exercises that I

                        Assuming that what I mean has become clear to you, 
                        I will go on from the schematically compositional 
                        arrangement to the configuration of dynamic forces 
                        and wonder: How is, for example, cause A1 to be 
                        configured?

                        The form of a horn, emerging from a broad base on 
                        the bottom left in order to end like a tip at the

                    <p>
                       Or, if I unite all the sweeping particles, this 
                        form:

                        For the configuration, this means a development or 
                        increase of energy from the bottom left towards the 
                        top right in a curving arrangement.

                    <p>
                        In fact, in the representation here, a devel

                        the surrounding white. When this energy arrangement 
                        is clear, the direction of motion will be so 
                        irrefutable that the arrow symbol can be omitted.

                        The white given, often seen, is a commonplace 
                        and will be taken in by means of the eye with 
                        little alacrity. As towards what the eye perceives 
                        as contrastingly special, the alacrity of the gaze 
                        increases towards point c. This extraordinary 
                        swelling of energy--or of energic fodder, in 
                        terms of reception--is inescapably related to the 
                        direction.

                        Or to get beyond white-black:
                        Let the given be water; enter fire. Then the case 
                        looks like this:

                        Such a movement is called "heating."
                        The heating arrow coming from the given "cold" looks

                        Let us touch briefly upon the colored movement between

                        The increase in red. Given lack of red, i.e., very

                    <p>
                        or, conversely, decrease of red; and all other 
                        possibilities of crescendo and decrescendo. So an 
                        abundance of configurative possibilities lie before us. 
                        One only has to reach out and help oneself, according 
                        to inner need, and the organs of the movement
                        composition are capable of configuration.

                        The back-and-forth of the pendulum (p. 117) passes again 
                        before our eyes. This is the dynamic compensation 
                        of errors or sur- <seg><figure xml:id="lesson9_figureQ"></figure></seg>  -pluses of move-
                        ment by means of the antitheses
                        of new errors and surpluses.
                        An extended account of the
                        stable, static analogy of this
                        case is in the chapter on static 
                        equilibrium (p. 37).

                        In order to reach the centrifugal pendulum 
                        oscillation at last (p. 119), to reach infinite 
                        movement, where the direction of the movement is of 
                        no consequence, I'll omit the arrow for now.

                    <p>
                        In this way, I obtain a unification of both cases, 
                        heating and cooling. Pathos turns into ethos, which 
                        encompasses forces and counter-forces, united, as 
                        you will see.

                        Represented more and more purely, the gray will 
                        become ever smaller, theoretically until it is as 
                        small as a point. For to the left of the gray point,

                        green still predominates and, to the right, red does. 
                        Due to the purification of gray's representation,

                    <p>
                        If, however, I let the purity of the gray 
                        achieve its completion as a point, then both gamuts
                        will necessarily readjust as diagonals.

                    <p>B. Review sessions, summer semester, 1922</p>
                    <p> R1  Monday, May 15, 1922</p>
                    <p>
                        1 My last word: Every more highly developed 
                        organism is a synthesis of differences. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2 The path to this discovery was analysis, 
                        i.e., the critical treatment of differences (parts), 
                        in themselves and in their relation to each other and 
                        to the whole.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3 I sought to give a face to the differences, 
                        some kind of meaning that was more than formal. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The practical solutions to the exercises I posed 
                        of course necessarily pertained to form first of all, 
                        as befits our métier. Yet the fundamental idea was to 
                        lend a nature-character to the different components, 
                        so that the composition could find its nature. 
                        Formalism, the new Academy, was thus to be avoided.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4 At the start of last semester, I began with 
                        the simple, inherently quiescent movement of the 
                        line:
                    </p>
                    <figure xml:id="lesson9_figureS"></figure>
                    <p>
                        I then demonstrated with a few examples how one can 
                        "accompany" this "melody" or how one can transcribe 
                        it, so that it spreads out (fills or determines the 
                        plane).
                    </p>
                    <p> Then I fixed the line at several points, </p>
                    <figure xml:id="lesson9_figureT"></figure>
                    <p>and it took on this concise, time-constrained character.</p>
                    <p>
                        Then I took the step towards the first fundamental  
                        difference in form,
                    </p>
                <pb/> 
                    <p>by leading the line back to its point of departure:</p>

                        Here there could be no more talk of elementary linear 
                        effect, since the effect here is the impression of 
                        a plane. The freely circumscribed circular plane and 
                        the time-constrained outline of three- and four-sided 
                        planes.

                        But they were not elementary planes either, 
                        since such elementary planes are not created by 
                        circumscribing with lines (i.e., by the movement of 
                        points), but by the movement of lines.

                    <p> So we have three characters to distinguish:</p>

                        where I and III are elementary principal characters, 
                        II an in-between character, a hybrid.

                        <cb n="left"/>
                        From the linear standpoint: <seg><figure xml:id="lesson9_figureAR"></figure></seg> 
                        This <seg><figure xml:id="lesson9_figureAN"></figure></seg>
                        character is <seg><figure xml:id="lesson9_figureAO"></figure></seg> active      
                        this  <seg><figure xml:id="lesson9_figureAP"></figure></seg> medial,
                        and this, <seg><figure xml:id="lesson9_figureAQ"></figure></seg> passive.
                        I.e., when active, the point 
                        works, and the effect is 
                        linear, corresponding to the 
                        movement of the point;
                        when medial, the move-
                        ment of the point leads via 
                        the detour of the outline to 
                        the impression of a plane;
                        when passive, the line 
                        works in a fundamentally 
                        planar way, and the impres-
                        sion is correspondingly 
                        planar. What can be seen  
                        as linear is a remnant,  
                        is suffered

                                1.  Storekeeper, give 
                                me a bucketful of 
                                these goods!

                                measures it out and 
                                charges 100 marks.

                                give me the same 
                                bucketful of these 
                                other goods.
                                The storekeeper  
                                measures, and it  
                                costs 200 marks.

                                are twice as heavy.
                                (The customer accepts
                                and pays.)

                                color valuation: more coveted, 
                                more beautiful, better, too 
                                satisfying, cooling, too hot,

                                too beautiful!

                        Color valuation is therefore not fixed, but purely 
                        imaginary. If it is too hot, one longs for green-blue, 
                        if it is too cold, one longs for yellow-red. The demand 
                        can change, taste can change.

                        General Review: The organizing of differences into unity, 
                        the uniting of the organs into an organism 
                        was, in manifold variations, time and again 
                        the goal of our theoretical investigations.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        For example: We see human bodies before us, day 
                        in and day out, and see them either as a whole 
                        (simply: a human being) or as an assembly of 
                        head, torso, arm, leg. As a whole it is called 
                        the synthetic view, as an assembly the analytic 
                        view. The end result is the same: in short, the 
                        human being; only the conception is different.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        The advantage to us of the analytical 
                        conception is that it makes parts in themselves and 
                        their interaction discernible. Yet every work is not a 
                        product from the start, not a work that is, but first 
                        and foremost a genesis, a work that becomes! No work 
                        is exactly determined from the start, but every work 
                        begins somewhere with motifs and grows beyond the 
                        organs into an organism.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And even construction, our goal here, is not 
                        already there, but is developed out of external and 
                        internal motifs into its parts and into the whole.

                    <p>
                        This is my task here as I have seen it from the beginning 
                        and all the more clearly with the passage of time:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Namely, the transmission of the experience I have  
                        gained in configuration conceptually (drawing and painting),  
                        which revolves around construction, from multiplicities 
                        into unity. I transmit this experience to you partly in 
                        syntheses (i.e., I let you see my work), partly in analyses 
                        (i.e., I break the works down into their essential parts).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I hand them over to you as playthings and give you the 
                        right to break these toys apart to see "how they are made."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In striving for content and in the effort to avoid 
                        mathematical formalism, for these reasons I offered various 
                        names for the relationship of the parts to one another 
                        and to the way they work together towards a whole, and, in 
                        order to go deeper, I offered concepts of the most diverse 
                        kind as a foundation.

                        Everyone will feel at home somewhere in this table. 
                        Perhaps it will tally with newly emerging work of 
                        your own made by free choice, and then analytical 
                        insights--partly as to form, partly as to content-- 
                        can be given to me about the work now emerging.

                        I will try to tell you a few useful things about colors.  
                        I base my remarks not just on my own thoughts but take up 
                        the thoughts of experts and others without hesitation in 
                        order to transmit these useful things to you. To cite a few 
                        names, I mention Goethe, Philipp Otto Runge, whose Color 
                        Sphere was published in 1810, Delacroix, and Kandinsky (The 
                        Spiritual in Art).

                        of notional paintbox for you, in which the colors receive a 
                        well-founded order, a kind of tool cabinet, if you like.

                        Nature gives us a wealth of color-stimulations, the 
                        plant world, the animal kingdom, minerals, the composition 
                        that people call "the landscape," all of which gives us 
                        hourly something to think about and be thankful for.

                    <p>
                        But one phenomenon stands above all these colored 
                        things, as an abstraction of every application, treatment, 
                        and blurring of color, as abstraction in the sense of 
                        colored purity, and that is the phenomenon of the rainbow.

                        This singular instance of a gamut of the pure colors N
                        occurs significantly not here on the earth but in the 
                        (earthly-cosmic) intermediate realm of the atmosphere and 
                        in consequence has a certain degree of perfection to offer,
                        but even so not the highest since it is merely half
                        otherworldly.

                    <p>
                        But here, too, our creative faculty enables us to rise 
                        above the imperfection of Seeming and arrive at a synthesis 
                        of the perfection of otherworldly Being.

                    <p>
                        We assume that what comes to us as Seeming--only with 
                        imperfections, only somewhat--that this might, without 
                        imperfection, be somewhere and that our artistic instinct 
                        must be a help to us in eliciting the form of this Being.

                        consist of, then??... From it, people inferred a series 
                        of colors, specifically seven colors with the names

                        And the number seven was generally pleasing. There were, 
                        after all, they said in support of this claim, seven 
                        principal pitches in music.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As strongly as the number seven appealed to me in many  
                        respects, in this case I didn't believe in it. For red-violet  
                        and blue-violet or indigo, as it is called in schoolbooks, 
                        are really rather tiny gradations in the division!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We all know that green, orange, and violet--as 
                        opposed to red, yellow, blue--are on a different level. 
                        (This much I can say in anticipation without spoiling a 
                        surprise later on.) But where to start with red-violet 
                        and blue-violet or indigo??

                        First, it is an essential fact that in the rain-
                        bow, the colors appear in a linear representation. One 
                        must not forget that a yellow point marches off in a line 
                        next to a green point, a green one next to a yellow one, 
                        and so forth.

                        arc as a circle, then a perfection--a color circle--is not

                        colored circles appear, nested in each other.<seg><figure xml:id="lesson10_figureE"></figure></seg>

                        Such a linear representation of a plane (so, in this case a re- 
                        presentation of a circular plane or a representation of a circle) 
                        has a snag: a circle formed from a red line is still not a red 
                        circle!
                    </p>
                    <figure xml:id="lesson10_fig3"></figure>
                    <p>
                        Because such a representation of a plane 
                        is, as we saw earlier, merely medial and not active.N This 
                        red or blue or yellow line perhaps conveys the impression 
                        of a plane but is not itself a plane; rather, it remains a 
                        line.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thus we can calmly designate the rainbow a linear <seg><figure xml:id="lesson10_figureF"></figure></seg> 
                        representation of colors and at the same time an inadequate 
                        representation of colors from which very little can be 
                        gathered--about the oppositional relationship between the 
                        colors really nothing. That is quite clear.

                    <p>
                        The principal deficiency, however, consists in the 
                        finiteness of this color series. Pure colors are an otherworldly 
                        affair. The mediating atmospheric realm is so good as to convey 
                        them to us--not, however, in their otherworldly form (which 
                        must be of an infinite nature), but in an in-between form.

                        The inconsistency in the two kinds of violet gains in 
                        importance, in interest, when we learn from the scientists 
                        that at its edges the spectrum actually spews out further: 
                        that beyond the red end there is said to be something else 
                        whose effect is heat and that the blue end, too, has its 
                        secret, which is expressed as a chemical effect.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In our rapture and thirst for color we could be tempted 
                        to sense two further, unknown, pure colors, for which our  
                        eyes are not adapted. We do not, however, want to be so daring.

                        We only want to state quite simply that it is here a 
                        question of half-meaures: the two halves should become a whole, 
                        the violets should become one violet, and the string shall 
                        be tied at its mysterious ends for infinity, endlessness.

                        7 to 1, seeking hither and thither, striving to get away

                        the spiritual-bodily domain that is half-at-rest and

                        the symbol of the circle, where the pure colors are in

                        The cosmic affair of the pure colors has found its fitting 
                        represention in a circle. The appearance, apprehensible on earth,  
                        of pure colors in the rainbow, which was only a reflection of an  
                        initially unknown totality, now formed as a synthesis and related  
                        to the great, otherworldly whole, lies be <seg><figure xml:id="lesson10_figureK"></figure></seg> fore our eyes as a

                        As a result, violet may be observed as the point of 
                        fracture caused by the assault of that power which conversely 
                        humanizes and transforms divine things, to reveal them to us.

                        That process would therefore have occurred in such a 
                        way that violence was done to the color circle at violet, 
                        with which the circle tore apart, stretched out and 
                        marched off as a series of color points in the rainbow.

                        If we consider more closely the newly obtained form for 
                        representing color, the colored plane of a circle, we 
                        recognize with interest how much more this new form is 
                        capable of expressing the relationships among colors.

                        First of all, the puzzles of the finite color 
                        series are solved or are no longer worth considering. 
                        There is nothing more to guess about violet in the 
                        gamut arrayed as a row. This new movement, adapted 
                        to an infinite merging of the colors into one 
                        another, has now become a matter of the circle's 
                        circumference, and I would like to call it peripheral 
                        movement.

                    <p>
                        This is one aspect of the novelty. The other 
                        aspect announces itself to us in the three diameters 
                        with which one can link the six colors and divide, 
                        articulate, them into three color pairs.

                    <p>
                        So, on the one hand, movement in a peripheral direction× 
                        and, on the other, movements in a diametrical direction, 
                        <seg><figure xml:id="lesson10_figureM"></figure></seg>along the diameters.

                    <p>
                        This second aspect of the novelty is so promising 
                        that we do not want to leave it for later. The three 
                        diameters, first of all, link red with green; second, 
                        yellow with violet; and third, blue with orange. 
                        Moreover, all three intersect at a point, the center 
                        of the circle. Surely a deeper meaning underlies this 
                        telling pictorial property of the color order. What 
                        is it?

                        Experience teaches first of all: If we let red 
                        affect our eye for a prolonged period, this color, 
                        when suddenly withdrawn, has a very strange effect on 
                        the eye--not as red but as green.

                    <p>
                        Or: If we expose our eyes to green for a long 
                        time, then red jumps out instead, as an aftereffect.

                        We will divide a long white strip into seven squares 
                        and then  cover six of the squares (with 
                        the exception of square seven) 
                        with thin, pure red watercolor.
                        When this red layer has 
                        dried, we will coat a thin, 
                        pure green watercolor over the 
                        underlying squares on the same 
                        strip (with the exception of square one).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After these two layers have dried, a reddish square 
                        one and a greenish square seven will appear. In between, 
                        however, will be five colorless squares: two to six.

                        We will liven up the somewhat weak effect of both 
                        these first stages combined if we continue the operation, 
                        alternating several times, applying the red from the top 
                        down and the green from the bottom up: first, 5 red 
                        squares from the top and 5 green squares from the bottom; 
                        second, 4 red squares from above and 4 green squares 
                        from below; then only 3 red squares from above and only 
                        3 green squares from below. And so on: ever fewer red 
                        squares (from above) and ever fewer green squares (from below).

                        This kind of color mixing is called glazing in the 
                        language of painters. It consists of adding separate 
                        batches over time. At every stage something is added. 
                        From left to right always a little less each time, 
                        from right to left always a little more. The result 
                        or, better, the sum remains the same.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through the gradation of the additions we obtain 
                        the final effect of a precisely graded movement from 
                        completely red to green-red to green or vice versa. 
                    </p>
                    <p> 1 totally red in the first square: 6 parts red no parts green</p>
                    <p> 7 totally green in seventh square: no parts red  6 parts green</p>
                    <p>  4 green-red in fourth square: 3 parts red  3 parts green</p>
                    <p> Between them are 2 red and 2 green gradations: </p>
                    <p> 2 in the 2nd square:  5 parts red  and  1 part  green</p>
                    <p> 3  "    3rd   "   :  4   "   red   "   2 parts green </p>
                    <p> 5  "    5th   "   :  2   "   red   "   4   "   green</p>
                    <p> 6  "    6th   "   :  1  part red   "   5   "   green</p>
                    <p>
                        And experience now teaches us clearly how red and 
                        green come to meet as they decrease, with the weighing 
                        scales balanced in the 4th square as red-green, or gray. 
                        Towards the middle, colorfulness decreases the more the 
                        quantities of red and green approach each other in a 
                        given square. Gray is not operated with directly, and 
                        yet (pure) gray has emerged where the quantities, as 
                        in the 4th square, are equal to each other. This lack 
                        of color at the middle decreases towards the top as 
                        well as towards the bottom: towards the top in favor 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        of increasingly red coloring, towards the bottom in favor 
                        of increasingly green coloring.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The reciprocal or correlative red-green gamut 
                        recalls once more, incidentally, our pendulum as motion  
                        and counter-motion.

                    <p>
                        It recalls, furthermore, the mobile weighing 
                        scales that finally come to a standstill at the gray 
                        intersection point,
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        though this is not to imply that red and green are 
                        therefore suited to static representation, that on the 
                        left there is only red and on the right only green. 
                        That would not lend the concept of reciprocity a 
                        concise form. Rather, green as well as red must leap 
                        from this side to that. (Configuration!) 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In sum, about the red/green pair I can thus 
                        say: 1. both colors reciprocally give rise to the 
                        other in the eye; 2. between both colors is gray. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the same way, I could demonstrate to you the 
                        two other diametrically opposed color pairs, namely, 
                        yellow/violet and blue/orange. As an alternative, I will
                    </p>
                <pb/> 
                    <p>
                        avail myself of yet another, more geometrical visualization, 
                        which on its own is applicable to all three diameters of 
                        the color circle.
                    </p>
                    <figure xml:id="lesson10_fig13"></figure>
                    <p>
                        In this case a violet and a yellow base stand opposed. 
                        Above, violet experiences its greatest extension, 
                        whereas yellow is only noticeable as a point on this 
                        base, so that, as far as measurement goes, it is 
                        omissible. Below, yellow experiences its greatest 
                        extension whereas violet is only a point on this yellow 
                        segment. If I now connect this yellow point with this 
                        yellow base, I obtain the yellow triangle; if I connect 
                        this violet point with its violet base opposite, I 
                        obtain the violet triangle. Both triangles thrust into 
                        each other. Each is by itself an expression of the 
                        diminution in its color as it recedes from the base. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now I divide the two bases into, say, twelve parts 
                        (fig. 14) and can in any one place measure the yellow 
                        and violet content of a segment parallel to the direc- 
                        tion of the base, and the effect will be roughly the
                    </p>
                    <p> × to be verified by measuring segments, where a point = zero</p>
                <pb/> 
                    <p> same, as earlier in the addition. Namely:</p>
                    <figure xml:id="lesson10_fig14"></figure>
                    <p>
                        The measurement result for the violet base is 12 parts violet 
                        and no parts yellow. For the yellow base, 12 parts yellow and 
                        no violet. In the middle, 6 parts violet and 6 parts yellow 
                        (therefore gray). Approaching the violet side of the base, 
                        10 parts violet and 2 parts yellow. On the yellow side, 
                        approaching the middle, 8 parts yellow and 4 parts violet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I can thus also say of the yellow/violet pair: gray 
                        stands between both colors. Experience with blue/orange 
                        would turn out just the same. In practice with these 
                        diametral gradations, it would be best to start out with 
                        a color that appears very pure to us, allow an effective 
                        amount to affect our eyes for an effective length of time,
                    </p>
                <pb/> 
                    <p>
                        and then, by quickly glancing at white, identify the 
                        matching complementary color; prepare it with the same 
                        intensity; and, by mixing in equal measures in a bowl or 
                        on paper, produce the colorless gray.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If this second criterion for color pairs 
                        failed, we would have to admit, conversely, that that 
                        we had not hit upon the components of gray in pure 
                        complementarity, and we would adjust either the one or 
                        the other component of the pair or, as so often happens, 
                        make a virtue of an error and consciously turn to false 
                        pairs, to enrich ourselves. More on this later.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let us now turn back to our color circle to 
                        express our satisfaction at how promptly the mathematical 
                        essence of the circle meets our efforts at representation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The radius (which is a half-diameter) cuts 
                        the circumference exactly six times, and, through the 
                        points of intersection corresponding to the six colors, 
                        one can lay the three diameters corresponding to the 
                        three main color pairs, which intersect at the center, 
                        the common gray-point of all color pairs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Of course, besides these three diameters, 
                        there are as many more diameters as you please, 
                        differing from those already mentioned not in their 
                        correctness but only in their fundamental significance. 
                        The slightest rotation of the diameter about the fixed 
                        gray-point indicates new color pairs that are correct, 
                        only less important.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In such a search for new color pairs, the simultaneity 
                        of motion and counter-motion gradually turns into infinite 
                        movement, and we reach the peripheral color relationships, 
                        where the endless movement annuls the direction of the 
                        arrow, having already been called into question by the 
                        simultaneity of motion and counter-motion.

                    <p>
                        Let us now turn our diameter to the exact spot 
                        between red and violet, that is to say between yellow and 
                        green, so that we thus identify the new color pair as
                        red-violet  yellow-green

                        The gray effect from this color pair will 
                        have to be composed of red-violet and 
                        yellow-green in equal parts.
                        And red-violet is in turn composed of red and 
                        violet in equal parts;
                        yellow-green is in turn composed of yellow 
                        and green in equal parts.
                        The gray effect is composed of the four 
                        components, red, violet, yellow, and green 
                        in equal parts.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        How I arrange these four components in order to visualize 
                        them is up to me.
                    </p>

                        <cb n="left"/>
                        If I combine them as a cross,

                    <p>
                        then I recognize in this arrangement, firstly, the already 
                        familiar color pair red/green and, secondly, the equally 
                        familiar color pair yellow/violet. Both, for their part, make 
                        gray, and, in the adding up of 2 grays (nota bene: halves), not 
                        an atom of color is added. The gray effect is proved and thus
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        also the genuineness of the red-violet  yellow-green 
                        color pair.

                    <p>
                        Algebraically, it looks like this:
                        ½red + ½violet + ½yellow + ½green =(½red+½green)+(½violet+½yellow)=
                        ½ gray  + ½ gray = gray
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With another rotation of the diameter around the 
                        gray-point, I stumble upon the new color pair,
                        blue-violet  yellow-orange.

                        But, as I forewarned earlier, if in terms of pairing 
                        colors we make any kind of error (any misalliance), then 
                        we will immediately encounter a difficulty with the gray 
                        proof. However, it will be good to take a closer look at 
                        the kind of deviation from genuine color pairs, because 
                        it is in no way stated that color composition should be 
                        restricted always to complementary colors.

                        I cannot, for example, link green with orange dia
                        metrically like this on the color circle, but only with 
                        a segment. Nor will it be possible to arrange the orange 
                        base parallel to the green base; rather, both bases will 
                        soon intersect somewhere.

                        that green stands exactly 
                        between yellow and blue,

                        The result of the mixture is not a pure colorless 
                        gray but a yellow-weighted gray, for one thing 
                        because yellow is contained in both green and 
                        orange and because the two bases are not parallel 
                        but intersect in the direction of yellow, tend 
                        towards yellow. The proof of genuineness has failed 
                        in the case of this color pair; thus, green/orange 
                        is not a genuine color pair.

                        The sum is a red-weighted gray. Red is found in both of

                        not parallel, but tend towards an intersection lying on 
                        the red side.

                        I believe this is enough for today. It will 
                        be reinforced, if necessary, in the practical 
                        exercise (in a week's time) and appear more vivid

                        The application can be thought of in various 
                        ways. I myself, in several works over the summer, 
                        have tried out all the partial color actions I 
                        have mentioned, one after another.

                    <p>
                        It need not disquiet us that these isolated 
                        efforts lack a total effect. We are striving 
                        precisely after just such a totality, and this 
                        again gives rise to new things. Smaller or larger 
                        groups of partial actions, when united, belong to 
                        a greater whole.

                        I would like to suggest the following, 
                        applied to the Bauhaus--or better yet, to a 
                        Hausbau:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First: Select the genuine color pairs in graded 
                        sonorities for three separate rooms.N Each single 
                        room would by itself constitute a part of the effect 
                        of the totality, based on red, yellow, and blue. 
                        The certain bias of the single room would then 
                        arouse the longing for new, complementary biases, 
                        which in their treatment of color would fulfill 
                        the longing. The given bias of the single room 
                        would furthermore have the excellent property of 
                        setting us in motion, making us at once enter 
                        the other rooms configured so as to complement 
                        the others. The impression of totality, however, 
                        would then arise if all the rooms were adapted in 
                        the pictorial as well as the actual sense.
                    </p>
                <pb/> 
                    <p>
                        For another occasion, I would suggest: treating 
                        three adjacent rooms, i.e., associated rooms, with 
                        color such that each of them by itself corresponds 
                        in sonority to one of the three false color pairs 
                        mentioned. Then, in the first we would have the 
                        feeling of a yellow load; in the second, the 
                        feeling of a blue load; and in the third, a red 
                        load. These three biases, however, would unite 
                        once again with the "adaptation" of all three 
                        rooms to give the impression of red-yellow-blue 
                        totality.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I take this suggestion from the next lecture in advance 
                        in order to give our theory today a livelier aftertaste. 
                        The story behind the three-color totality mentioned 
                        here remains yet to be consolidated and justified.

                        This diametral movement and gradation of colors 
                        that we treated theoretically and practically in the 
                        last meetings has provided us with some fun, I think. 
                        In practical terms, we have discovered quite a lot, 
                        especially regarding the order. We have been able to 
                        assign a place to many in-between tones long familiar 
                        to us. If we did not always succeed in determining 
                        the color pairs exactly, we have at least recognized, 
                        precisely because it was so difficult and because 
                        gray is only one point on a large plane, that the  
                        greatest exactitude is the basis of these relationships. 
                        And specifically in two directions. In the diametral 
                        sense, there arose the difficulty of balancing the 
                        ends with regard to the intensity of the color content. 
                        In the peripheral sense it was a question of deter
                        mining the point, halfway around the circumfer
                        ence, that corresponded to any given point on the 
                        periphery.
                        In ordinary language: not taking too much or too  
                        little of any color and not hitting any false colors.

                        Optical science may well have to make its way  
                        through these two conditions to furnish experimental 
                        proof of the truth. For us, however, other points 
                        of view apply which relate only partially with the 
                        scientific. And we gain just as much experience if 
                        we miss the mark of precise correctness.

                        color movement, to movement that proceeds around the 
                        circumference. This movement is infinite, in contrast 
                        to the pendulum-like movement along the diameter. It 
                        has no endpoints. Not pairings, but rather transitions 
                        continuously follow upon one another. There is no 
                        interruption here, and every beginning becomes an end 
                        again. Unbroken movement prevails over direction (this 
                        clock can run backwards, too), whereas the diametral 
                        movement was only able to rise above direction by 
                        interrupting itself and becoming movement back and 
                        forth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nevertheless, a weakly character should not be 
                        imputed to peripheral movement, nor should it be said 
                        that a pronounced articulation is not recognizable 
                        here. The qualitative differences on a short section 
                        of the circumference are already too great.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, in the neighborhood of red, the 
                        differences of character between orange and violet are 
                        far too significant.

                        And this is the case even though red is contained 
                        in both colors. How enormous the differences will be 
                        between red and another color containing no red!

                        (For the purposes of today) I will not now ask, 
                        "What is red?" Instead I ask, "What does it not mean?" 
                        That is to say, when does it stop having an effect? 
                        What is its range?

                    <p>
                        And we will hardly go wrong if we give its range 
                        the leeway of two thirds of the circumference.

                        Last time we saw that it quite  
                        certainly did not mean green, for  
                        red and green annihilate each

                        But there is however a yellowish red  
                        (so-called warm red), and likewise there is a bluish

                        Bluish and yellowish,

                        tion in terms of red. So  
                        a diminution in red towards 
                        both sides must be ascertained --or, conversely, an increase in 
                        red from these two sides, towards red.
                        This increase from the two sides leads naturally  
                        to a peak, towards the peak point <seg><figure xml:id="lesson11_figureC"></figure></seg> that culminates 
                        at the height of the red.

                        brief
                        I shall make matters somewhat (briefer), however, and 
                        simply gather by contemplating the sketches that: 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Blue, as well as yellow and red, has a range 
                        of two thirds on the circumference. The last third, 
                        however, remains free, free of blue, of yellow, or of 
                        red. Indeed, the blue-free third lies between both 
                        the yellow and red peak points, the yellow-free third 
                        between both the blue and red peak points, and the red
                        free third between the blue and yellow peaks. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Every peak, every culmination point, therefore 
                        remains free for a moment from the color influence of 
                        both neighboring peaks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And thus I can now (not only) say (red is not green, 
                        but also) red is not blue and not yellow, even if it
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        can be bluish or yellowish. In the same way blue can 
                        stretch out towards red and yellow, but never reach 
                        the peaks of these two neighbors. And yellow can tend 
                        towards blue and red, but can never be blue and red.

                        its own peak, from there to fade away again slowly into 
                        its nothingness, that is, the other neighboring peak. 
                        If I give the naturalistic form to this crescendo and 
                        diminuendo or the ex'act form, it amounts to the same.

                        This arithmetic table corresponds to the only 
                        satisfactory practical way to represent peripheral 
                        color movement in practice. For if the fact of

                        consideration, one arrives at mixtures that are too

                        and red and blue. We are therefore fully justified in

                        In order to represent the inferiority of the 
                        secondary colors in the simplest manner, I can now hold 
                        onto the three culmination points of the primary colors 
                        without the circle, by linking them in another form.

                        If the pure red at its peak should contain 
                        neither blue nor yellow, should be neither bluish cool 
                        nor yellowish warm, then this can only be true at 
                        one single brief spot, in the sense of the naturally 
                        circling movement nourished by transitional states of 
                        waxing and waning. The behavior is exactly the same

                        at the brief pure spots on the blue and yellow hills. But 
                        the characteristic sign for a brief moment is the point.

                    <p>
                        Through the direct connection of the three points 
                        I obtain the equilateral triangle BYR. The sides of 
                        the triangle, in contrast, are not brief moments but 
                        sliding ranges that correspond to the wash character  
                        or differential character of the secondary colors. 
                        I would like to advise you in advance to imagine no 
                        up or down on this triangle. (Otherwise, I would have 
                        stood it securely on a plane.) Place it, rather, lying 
                        flat on the ground. (You will see why next time.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If it is lying flat on the ground I can step inside. 
                        If I turn towards R, then I have a figure before me 
                        that is an ex'act representation of the the red hill.

                    <p>
                        If I turn towards B, before me stands a pyramid, like 
                        a blue mountain (there really are such mountains), 
                        and, turning toward Y, I see the Gelber Berg, or 
                        Yellow Mountain. In this respect as well the triangle 
                        is a good form. One can reach the peaks of these 
                        mountains from both sides, and two paths lead down 
                        again. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Halfway along the path, however, let us 
                        reflect for a moment that, whether headed uphill or 
                        down, we have now got half of the way behind us.
                    </p>
                <pb/> 
                    <p>
                        At these places on the triangle laid out flat on the 
                        ground, we again find new indifference points there 
                        on the segment of differences--points that divide 
                        the segment into two halves, and points at which the 
                        secondary colors are pure, i.e., which contain both 
                        bordering principal colors in equal parts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this way each of the triangle's sides falls 
                        apart into two halves, into bluish and yellowish, into 
                        yellowish and reddish, and into reddish and bluish 
                        halves.

                        With this I gain a new image for the peripheral 
                        movement that, because it represents the perimeter of 
                        a triangle, has the advantage of clearer articulation 
                        into primary and secondary color values. Blue, yellow, 
                        and red are placed in dominant positions; green, orange, 
                        and violet in dependent ones. The triangle has this 
                        advantage over the circle.

                        But not only this; it can provide even 
                        clearer information than the circle about the dividing 
                        lines that we called diametral movement. For example, 
                        the red-green bisecting line, seen 
                        as a plumb line, is very instruc- 
                        tive on the green side. This  
                        plumb line hits the green 
                        indifference point.

                <pb/> 
                    <p>
                        And this green indifference point is again explained by 
                        the flanking green components, blue and yellow.

                        We therefore have the red-green bisectional  
                        movement, or the complement-movement.

                    <p>
                        The blue tip hits the orange side (complement) and the orange

                        There are so many clever people, and there 
                        always have been. And so the Canonical Meaning of 
                        blue yellow red has long been known, a meaning with 
                        reference to the completeness of these three and 
                        with reference to their equilibrium.

                        One can say that none of the three voices

                        too much or too little of any of them. This is a 
                        law worth heeding, provided one is on one's guard 
                        against a schematism that will translate the naked 
                        law into the thing.

                        Such misunderstandings lead to construction for

                        chested asthmatics who give laws instead of works, 
                        who have too little breath in them to grasp that laws 
                        should serve only as a basis for things to bloom; 
                        that one only seeks out laws to test how works

                        deviate from the natural works around us, from 
                        the land, animals, and people, without becoming 
                        unreasonable about it; that laws are merely a common

                        Thus one can hear statements like: Do not use 
                        gray, only ever use the components of gray, the 
                        complementary colors! Gray is already contained in 
                        them! Gray comes into existence on its own.

                    <p>
                        Or: Only use the primary colors, blue, yellow, 
                        red, in their most perfect purity! And in their most 
                        perfect equilibrium! For they encompass all the other 
                        colors in themselves! All the other colors come then

                        I would like to warn against such rule-bound

                        For otherwise we could in the end arrive at gray 
                        itself, which, after all, lies at the center of the 
                        whole, on the grounds that in this gray is contained 
                        everything about color: blue, yellow, and red, and 
                        also black and white. The consequence of this truth 
                        in conformity with the law would then be: Are all 
                        colors frowned upon, even black and even white? Only 
                        gray is allowed, indeed, only the one central gray. 
                        The result: gray in a gray world?? No! Even less: the 
                        world as a single gray, as nothing.

                        1) The confusion of the law with the work, of the

                        operation, would be supported by the symbol of the 
                        three points. They are the formula of a triangle.

                    <p>
                        2) Yet the triangle itself says much more. The three 
                        sides symbolize the whole color movement that takes 
                        place on these sides, the whole perimeter.

                        3) Complementary movements along the bisecting line 
                        also have a triangular nature in 
                        a certain sense, though somewhat 
                        concealed by the fact that the 
                        secondary color stands in place of 
                        its two complements. A complemen
                        tary movement is therefore quite

                        symbol. The law of totality is

                        Green/orange is supratriangular, has one yellow 
                        point too many, hence the yellow load.

                        Violet/orange is also supratriangular, double
                        triangular, or quadrilateral. This movement 
                        results in one red point too many, hence the 
                        red load.

                        Green/violet is supratriangular, double-triangular, 
                        or quadrilateral. One blue point over the formula 
                        for totality, hence the blue load.

                        <seg><figure xml:id="lesson11_figureAL"></figure></seg>These color actions do not always correspond to the 
                        law of totality, as you saw. Sometimes they leave 
                        out one point and sometimes they give one of the 
                        three points too much weight. These last two actions 
                        are not to be described as total but as partial 
                        actions.

                    <p>
                        Are they therefore to be rejected? 
                        Certainly not. In the sense of totality they are 
                        only in need of expansion, but they are also 
                        capable of expansion.

                        Time also plays an essential role in 
                        the domain of the pictorial, as I discussed in an 
                        earlier course. Even partial actions take place 
                        in time. So a partial action, if it has had some 
                        success and was well organized as a part, need by 
                        no means be abandoned. <seg><figure xml:id="lesson11_figureAM"></figure></seg>One can, a little later, 
                        <seg><figure xml:id="lesson11_figureAN"></figure></seg>restore it to totality. One can fetch totality 
                        later, over time, as I recently suggested to you 
                        with the example of the three rooms.

                        The two-point partial action blue-red could be 
                        much smaller yet, e.g., only from blue to violet, 
                        and would be quite easily expandable to totality:
