                       By way of introduction, a brief clarifi-
                       cation of concepts. First, what the concept 
                       of "analysis" encompasses: In ordinary con-
                       versation one usually hears mention of 
                       chemists' analyses. For instance, a certain 
                       preparation sells well due to its excellent 
                       effect. The manufacturer's profits make 
                       other manufacturers curious, and they 
                       take a sample of it to the chemist so 
                       that he can analyze it. He must proceed 
                       methodically in order to break the prepa-
                       ration down into its component parts. To 
                       solve the riddle.

                    <p>
                       In another case, a stimulant proves to have 
                       grave consequences for health. Here also the 
                       chemist must be called upon to reveal the 
                       harmful components through an analysis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       In both cases the given substance is a 
                       whole composed of different, initially unknown
                    </p>
                <pb/> 
                    <p>
                       parts; the components are what is sought after.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       In our business, the motives or 
                       inducements that lead us to make analyses 
                       are of course different. We do not analyze 
                       works that we would like to copy, nor works 
                       we have reason to distrust.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       We investigate the paths that 
                       another has followed in the creation of 
                       a work in order, by becoming familiar 
                       with these paths, to get going ourselves.
                       This type of examination should prevent 
                       us from regarding the work as something 
                       rigid, immutably fixed. By means of such 
                       exercises we can prevent ourselves from 
                       sneaking up on a finished work only to 
                       quickly pluck up what stands out the 
                       most and run off with it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       A special type of analysis is the

                <pb/> 
                    <p>
                       examination of the work through the stages 
                       of its emergence. I designate this type with 
                       the word "genesis." The first book of Moses, 
                       which deals with the creation of the world, 
                       is also called Genesis. There it is written 
                       what God created on the first day, what 
                       on the second, and so forth. The universe 
                       surrounding us undergoes a historical 
                       articulation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       We are makers, working practitioners, 
                       and hence it is natural that here we shall 
                       move chiefly in a formal domain, all the 
                       while not forgetting that before the formal 
                       beginning, or (put more simply) before the 
                       first stroke, lies an entire prehistory: not 
                       only, say, the yearning, the human desire 
                       to express oneself, not only the outward 
                       necessity to do so, but also a general human 
                       condition, whose orientation is called a 
                       weltanschauung, which, with an inner necessity,
                    </p>
                <pb/> 
                    <p>
                       urges its manifestation in this or that 
                       direction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       I emphasize this lest the misunder-
                       standing arise that a work consists only 
                       of form.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       But on the other hand, I must empha-
                       size here even more that the most precise 
                       scientific knowledge of nature, plants, 
                       animals, the earth and its history, or 
                       of the stars is useless to us if we are 
                       not provided with all the tools for their 
                       representation; that the profoundest 
                       understanding of the synergy of these 
                       things in the universe is of no use to 
                       us if we are not also equipped with forms 
                       directed towards that purpose; that the 
                       deepest feeling, the most beautiful soul, 
                       is useless unless we have the proper forms 
                       at hand.

                       After these general premises, I shall 
                       begin where the pictorial form actually 
                       begins, with the point that sets itself 
                       in motion.

                        After the <graphic url=".../number1"/> pen or something else 
                        with a pointed tip is applied, a line 
                        promptly emerges. (The more freely it takes 
                        its jaunt initially, the clearer its mobile 
                        nature will be.)<graphic url="..."/>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But if I apply a line with the angular 
                        edge of some black or colored material, then 
                        a plane emerges (initially, and if the jaunt 
                        it takes is very restricted).
                        <graphic url="..."/>

                    <p>
                        If we had a material with which to push planes 
                        forth with a similar effect, then we could 
                        inscribe such a notional sculpture in space.
                        <graphic url="..."/>
                        But that is, alas, a utopia.

                    <p>
                        So let us tarry for the moment with the most 
                        primitive device: with the line. In the pre-
                        history of peoples, where writing and drawing 
                        still coincide, it is the given element. Also our
                    </p>
                <pb/> 
                    <p>
                        children usually begin in this way. One day 
                        they discover the phenomenon of the mobile 
                        point, and one can scarcely imagine their 
                        enthusiasm. With the greatest of freedom, 
                        the pen initially moves wherever it pleases. 
                        Once these first works are examined, 
                        however, the discovery is immediately made 
                        that the paths traversed have now become 
                        fixed in ink. Now then, children who 
                        continue to take pleasure in chaos are of 
                        course not image-makers, but other children 
                        will soon progress to a certain order. 
                        The critique of the journeys made by the 
                        pen begins. The chaos of the initial play 
                        gives way to an incipient conformity to set 
                        principles and patterns.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The freedom with which the line is 
                        guided submits to the anticipated final 
                        effect. Now, out of caution, one begins 
                        to work with very few lines to achieve an 
                        effect. One remains primitive.

                    <p>
                        Yet one cannot persist stubbornly in this 
                        primitivity. One will have to discover a 
                        means of enriching the meager end result 
                        without destroying or blurring the simple, 
                        clear arrangement. One must classify.

                        With all these examples, the principal line goes 
                        forth freely and unbound. It is, so to speak, a 
                        stroll taken for its own sake. Without a goal.

                        has a deadline, it wants to go as fast as 
                        possible to 1, then to 2, to 3, and so 
                        on. One might say it is rather more like 
                        running errands than taking a stroll. The 
                        straight lines indicate as much. But both 
                        the free line and the line with a time 
                        limit are of a purely active type.

                        In these new cases the time-constrained

                        As a line it is marked by its calming 
                        character and by its lack of a beginning or 
                        an end. Considered in elemental terms (as an 
                        action of the hand) it is certainly still 
                        a line, but once it has been completed, 
                        the mental image of linearity is superseded 
                        immediately by that of planarity. With it, 
                        the mobile character also disappears (no one 
                        looking at the disk of the moon would attempt 
                        to ride a carousel around its perifery), 
                        replaced by the notion of the most complete 
                        quiescence (chiefly in the instance of the 
                        circle).

                        character.

                        One indeed also sees lines, but it is not 
                        a matter of linear actions but of the linear 
                        results of planar actions. The line is not 
                        made but rather is suffered.

                        Running contrary to the trajectory of this 
                        short account of the line, and at the same 
                        time contained within it, is an account of 
                        the plane. When active, the line divided  
                        [it] into imaginary planes. In between, the 
                        plane-character pushed its way forth; it then 
                        became active when the line was designated as 
                        passive.

                        <graphic url="..."/>

                        relation to its length, until finally one may 
                        speak of the coincidence of A and B, with which 
                        we have arrived once again at the active line.

                        We were occupied 14 days ago with, among other 
                        things, the free line. I chose as an example a type 
                        that corresponded to a relaxing walk, without an 
                        express purpose, without an express goal.

                        This line had a certain inherent quiescence 
                        and harmony, and as a theme in a composition its 
                        realization would have required accompanying forms 
                        and so would have corresponded more to the folk-
                        song form in music than to a more artistic form.

                        Sure enough, only accompanying forms or substitute

                        The essential difference between this new

                        convergence is best illustrated if we think 
                        of each line, for instance, as the path taken 
                        by a person. You can speak of friendship in 
                        the previous examples; there is no drifting 
                        apart. But with this new divergent example 
                        we see our fellow stroller crossing our path 
                        just once, at point D.

                        Let us imagine this (fig. 5) to 
                        be railway tracks. Now, is there 
                        not something very misleading 
                        about this? Because these lines 
                        are truly divergent enough! 
                        Railway tracks that are 
                        constantly spreading further 
                        apart would result in the 
                        loveliest derailment. Or, 
                        if you took the opposite 
                        direction:

                        railway tracks that will soon 
                        intersect at some point beyond; 
                        is this not almost more alarming?

                    <p>
                        How does this happen, then? Well, without noticing, 
                        we have stepped out of the concept of planarity 
                        into the territory of space, into the third 
                        dimension. We are doing perspective.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Last time, we established with regret, first 
                        of all, that we have no kind of spatial writing: 
                        Unlike the movement from points <graphic url="..."/> to lines
                        or the movement from lines <graphic url="..."/> to planes, we cannot
                        analogously move
                        <graphic url="..."/> planes forth with any visible effect, so 
                        as to produce solids. We must therefore make do 
                        with perspective.

                    <p>
                        But it will not take long to explain nor 
                        prove difficult if we confine ourselves to its 
                        principal features. And the explication of the 
                        inherent phenomena is quite remarkable!

                        These (fig. 7), then, are railway 
                        tracks. Railway tracks lie on 
                        crossties. How do I depict this? 
                        If I had drawn tracks on the 
                        plane, like a surveyor or carto- 
                        grapher, then we would have the

                    <p>
                        and the ties would be placed at regular

                        between the ties increases noticeably, as most 
                        Europeans know, towards the foreground.

                        pay particular attention as well to the side walls. 
                        Just as on the plane of the floor the vertical

                        Inside the now familiar space I have constructed 
                        a second one that offers the eye a view of its upper 
                        plane. Hence, one can speak more aptly of a volume 
                        than of a spatiality that ends within our eye's visual 
                        field, since actual spaces extend beyond our visual 
                        field. (We are inside them.) Thus, a volume that 
                        offers the eye a view of its upper plane.

                    <p>
                        In this case the volume does not offer a  
                        top view of its upper plane. If we assume it  
                        is made of glass, then it offers, on the contrary,  
                        a view of this plane from below.

                    <p>
                        Such a horizontal plane that can be seen  
                        from below, however, is situated above our eye; <graphic url="..."/> 
                        it is higher than we are.

                    <p>
                        The other horizontal plane our eye sees from 
                        above is lower than our eye; it lies below us.<graphic url="..."/>

                        In this third case, 
                        however, something 
                        special occurs. The  
                        eye is unable to re- 
                        cognize the upper plane 
                        as such, whether from  
                        above or from below;  
                        rather, it appears

                        <cb n="right"/>
                        The volume is thus 
                        exactly as high as 
                        our eye.

                        (Splitting hairs, one could add that the lengthwise 
                        and crosswise graduation coincide.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What is valid for this horizontal plane 
                        is logically valid also for the corresponding 
                        horizontal lines on both side walls. These 
                        horizontal lines at eye level appear again as 
                        horizontal in the perspectival projection.

                        the plane of the horizon. Remaining at point A1, for 
                        example, a huge circular disc.

                        human being, taking into account the earth's 
                        attraction. The feeling for the vertical is alive 
                        in us so that we do not fall, and if we must, we 
                        correctively stretch out our arms so as to again 
                        balance out the error. In exceptional cases we 
                        extend the horizontal, like the tight-rope walker

                        be verified or investigated by means of a very simple 
                        apparatus. A pane of glass is brought into a fixed vertical 
                        position and placed near the eyes in front of the object 
                        to be projected. The observations must be made with one 
                        eye, fixed in its position. With ink or grease pencil the 
                        important essential lines of the object are drawn onto the 
                        pane of glass. <graphic url="..."/>
                        Lines recorded on a pane of glass that is not standing 
                        vertically will be seen as incorrect, distorted images. 
                        Similar distorted images are produced by photographers who, 
                        from a low angle, take pictures of an object that can be 
                        easily controlled in <graphic url="..."/>
                        perspective, for <graphic url="..."/>
                        example, a house.
                        To be precise, such images are not
                        at all false objectively.

                        are closer to the eye than the upper windows and there- 
                        fore are wider. But that is where a human being objects, 
                        because one wants to have the horizontal and the vertical 
                        fixed so that one does not begin to wobble, to get 
                        dizzy. The value of this whole procedure lies simply in 
                        the possibility of controlling, of monitoring. Drawing 
                        in correct perspective has therefore no value, because 
                        everyone can do it in this way.

                        words, the weighing-up of weights. Forces of this 
                        kind are closest to us, since we ourselves are  
                        physically subject to these same laws of weight. 
                        For this, we still want to assume the solid 
                        ground on which we usually stand,  and not 
                        (as happens exceptionally) go into the water or 
                        indeed the air.

                        As an instrument for this weighing, a pair of 
                        scales can be as useful to us as it is to the 
                        grocer in his shop.

                        A set of scales looks roughly like this. It 
                        weighs two weights against each other and, 
                        as there are only two, they can operate in 
                        a plane. For, wherever they are located in 
                        space, I can always bring two points into one 
                        single plane. (Supposing)

                        extends over three axes, AB, CD, and EF. With 
                        these scales one can ascertain the weights on 
                        the walls of a space constructed as a hexagon 
                        (fig. 6).

                        is standing or hanging (figs. 3 and 3a); what is 
                        essential is the cross made by the horizontal with 
                        the vertical. This is the spirit of the scales,

                        this figure (13a) permits two conceptions, one 
                        linear and one planar. Conceived in terms of lines, 
                        it is a quadrilateral with both diagonals; in terms 
                        of planes, it is a quadrilateral divided into four  
                        triangles. These four triangles arrange themselves, 
                        particularly if we do not take the quadrilateral 
                        as a square, as two pairs of triangles lying 
                        opposite each other.

                        The primitive simplicity of this case of a 
                        balancing act has allowed me to proceed 
                        symbolically, so to speak. The result is of a 
                        symmetrical nature, because the same kind of 
                        weights are on both sides.

                        A state of equilibrium diverging from 
                        symmetry could be illustrated with the image 
                        of a pair of scales with, for example, two one-
                        pound weights in one pan and, in the other, one 
                        750-gram weight and one 250-gram weight.

                        It is certain that with the correctly 
                        measured dose on either side, we can consider 
                        equilibrium to be established, that is, an 
                        equilibrium that is no longer identical with 
                        symmetry. In order, however, for either side 
                        to be identified with certainty as part and 
                        counterpart, so to speak, surely something 
                        beyond this rather rough comparison is needed. 
                        A local imperative must intervene, one which 
                        cannot be avoided in our assessment. Every 
                        conclusive example goes fundamentally beyond a 
                        loose comparison:

                        Here such a local imperative has intervened, i.e., 
                        a particular idea underlies the position of the 
                        energic weights:

                        The axis AB, overloaded with the heavier 
                        red, has sunk to A and risen to B. Originally 
                        it lay horizontally (a-b). Both these axes, the 
                        original ab and the new AB share a single point 
                        in common, the point C. C is therefore the 
                        pivot. The result of this rotation of the axis 
                        is that red, on the left, is lower than light 
                        red, on the right. Now to compensate, dark red 
                        intervenes and will be in a position to provide 
                        the compensation.

                        The upper part of the 
                        body is too heavy; the 
                        vertical falls to the 
                        left if the correction 
                        below does not occur in 
                        time. One widens the

                        the left leg.

                        The character of both these schematic 
                        compositions is centric, i.e., their arrangement 
                        is in reference to a center point.

                    <p>
                        Thinking now of such compositional actions 
                        repeated many times from below to above, we 
                        then have a series of such center points, one 
                        above the other, and we can then no longer 
                        speak of a centric arrangement. This series of 
                        points C takes on the appearance of a spinal 
                        column, as you will see.

                        I is thought of as a 
                        socle, II as the first 
                        stone on this socle, 
                        laid just at the tipping 
                        point. One can imagine 
                        the force that would 
                        tip it over having 
                        its expression in the 
                        arrow, →, and its measure in the weight, w.

                        If one now thinks of this sort of construction 
                        carried forward, alternating from left to right, 
                        then an actual tipping will be avoided. Each stone 
                        pulls, so to speak, at the vertical axis, each 
                        wants to make the horizontal pivot at its point CI 
                        or CII or CIII.

                        By unraveling the basic schema of this building

                        addition to other possibilities):

                        Buildings of this kind (like towers) are comparable 
                        to a person standing. As the effort to maintain his or 
                        her balance becomes taxing, the person sits down and 
                        reduces this task by about half. If he or she leans back 
                        against something, then only a remnant of the balancing

                        activity is left, but nevertheless still a

                        fall off a chair in certain circumstances. 
                        This remnant only disappears completely in 
                        the recumbent position. The person becomes a

                        tempo in comparison to the drama of the vertical 
                        character--which naturally does not exclude a 
                        weighing-up on each side. The vertical is always 
                        still there!

                        I am arriving at the essence of the weight of

                        "Do you consider this square heavy or light?" As 
                        such, there is no definite answer. For if the 
                        answer were "light!" and I added a second much 
                        smaller square,

                    <p>
                        it would thus immediately invalidate the hasty reply, 
                        for now the square makes an impression of being 
                        considerably heavier. One can now say that the 
                        large square is heavy in comparison with the small 
                        one and that the small one is light in comparison 
                        with the large one. Relativities.

                        Now, however, both these weights can hold their own 
                        against one another. And why? One is lighter in terms 
                        of energy, though much larger, and the other is very 
                        heavy in terms of energy, though small in size.
                    </p>
                <pb/>
                    <p>
                        One cannot decide so lightly which is actually 
                        heavier. In this undecided case, the assumption 
                        of the given equilibrium is intuitively close 
                        at hand, implied in our indecisiveness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The effect of weight is more a question of 
                        quantity on the left, in comparison to the 
                        right, where it expresses itself more qualita- 
                        tively. Relativities!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The assumption that black is heavier than 
                        white only applies as long as we move on the 
                        white plane as a precondition. In this case, 
                        if we disregard color, black is the device for 
                        developing energy. The blacker the energy, the 
                        heavier the impression of weight compared to 
                        the white plane. Again, a relativity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If, by contrast, one takes a black plane 
                        as given, then a black energy cannot therefore 
                        express itself on that plane, precisely because 
                        its weightiest development, deep black, would 
                        not stand out at all. Therefore in this case, 
                        as long as we disregard color, white is the 
                        given energy, and it is precisely the brightest 
                        white that has the qualifications for producing 
                        the heaviest effects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On a gray plane of medium tone, black and 
                        white can rival each other as energies.

                    <p>
                        Outdoors, for example in the countryside, 
                        one may assume a white plane as given if the 
                        weather is foggy. The things that are closest 
                        by (and thus the heaviest) stand out to us  
                        as particularly dark, whereas heading into  
                        the distance everything grows gradually

                    <p>
                        lighter until finally it merges entirely with 
                        the background.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the dark of night, areas of brightness, 
                        such as illuminated windows, have the strongest 
                        and heaviest effect.

                    <p>
                        And on a normal day, one can observe the 
                        interaction of dark and light against a medium 
                        tonality.

                        In physics one speaks of specific weight 
                        in comparison to water. In our case, there 
                        are several specific weights, in comparison to 
                        white, to black, or to the average of the two 
                        (and to every gradation between).

                        <graphic url=".../lesson4_fig4"/>

                    <p>or this structure:</p>

                        (figs. 4 and 5) If one compares their 
                        numerical expression, both structures resemble 
                        each other to a tee. The difference lies only 
                        in the choice of means for representing them 
                        pictorially. (fig. 4) The first case makes 
                        use only of the measures "single segment" and 
                        "double segment," while the second case makes 
                        use only of the weights, light and dark. In 
                        other words, measure in one case, weight in the 
                        other.N Or, in one case, a force that achieves 
                        the greater output, 2, without a greater effort 
                        but through a doubling of the time in which it 
                        occurs; and in the other, a force that works 
                        towards its greater output only with doubled 
                        energy.

                    <p>
                        Note: I would like to provide a picture frame with a 
                        hook; I measure the upper horizontal very accurately to 
                        find the center. I attach the hook exactly at the midpoint
                    </p>
                <pb/> 
                    <p>
                        and am convinced that now nothing else is lacking. Yet 
                        in the end, the picture still hangs crooked on the wall.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And why is it hanging crooked? Because the 
                        density of the wood is not uniform or because the glass 
                        is possibly thicker and heavier on one side. In short, I 
                        have made the mistake of measuring instead of weighing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In another case I want to cut a very long wooden 
                        pole into exactly two halves. It seems to me that the 
                        simplest way is to balance the pole on a sharp edge. I 
                        am pleased with my sharp-wittedness and happily saw on. 
                        The result: two pieces of entirely different lengths. Why,  
                        then? The wood must have varied in its thickness and 
                        weight, and I made the mistake of proceeding by weighing 
                        instead of measuring.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, on the one hand, measure; on the other, 
                        weight. I return to both our higher-order structures 
                        and consider the numerical series they share in 
                        common:
                        1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This series does not change if I represent it thus: 
                        (1 + 2)+(1 + 2)+(1 + 2)+(1 + 2), etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This, then, equals:
                        3   +   3   +   3   +   3    And this is the 
                        regular repetition of a type of unit (tripartite), 
                        and therefore again a purely structural case.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This algebraic maneuver corresponds pictorially 
                        to the following conception:

                        thus  3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = I + I + I + I + I, where 
                        Roman numeral one stands for a higher unit.

                        Thus, the entire square of this structure is 
                        articulated as joined pairs of two neighboring 
                        squares in the horizontal and vertical:

                    <p>
                        Whereupon there emerges an articulation into four
                        sided, four-part units with a value of six:
                        6 + 6 + 6       I + I + I
                        +   +   +
                        6 + 6 + 6   or  I + I + I
                        +   +   +
                        6 + 6 + 6       I + I + I
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This regular repetition of a higher unit is, 
                        however, characteristic of a structural formation.

                        (figs. 7a and 8) A variant of the concept of 
                        this chessboard structure with emphasis on the 
                        diagonals offers us a linear structure with two 
                        different qualities of line, which again can be 
                        read reciprocally as the rhythm of four-part units. 
                        These units take the shape of squares standing on 
                        their vertices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And in this way one can invent fascinating 
                        higher-order structural motifs; as soon as any 
                        repeating rhythm can be verified, its structural 
                        character is established.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It cannot be claimed that such rhythms are 
                        inherently of an organic character. This is 
                        confirmed at a first glance at the corresponding 
                        numerical series. Every organism is an individuum, 
                        a word meaning "indivisible." That is to say, one 
                        cannot remove anything from it without altering the 
                        character of the whole or, in the case of living 
                        beings, without impairing the function of the whole 
                        or even stopping it outright. Likewise, nor can one 
                        add something to it.

                    <p>
                        Our numerical series and numerical complexes 
                        retain their sub-organic, dividual character 
                        if we, instead of 1 + 1 + 1 + 1,   put: 1 + 1 + 1,
                        or: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1;

                        or: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3;
                        instead of 6 + 6 + 6  put: 6 + 6  or: 6 + 6 + 6 + 6
                                   +   +   +       +   +      +   +   +   +

                        of those single-cell bacteria that are only

                        A great advantage, however, also lies in the 
                        individual insignificance of the structural 
                        rhythms: they can be easily arranged into 
                        an organic, individual whole, supporting the 
                        organism's being--without opposing it anywhere.

                        Individual rhythms, conversely, cannot be 
                        reduced to one or to similar numbers but must 
                        stop inexorably at proportions like 2:3:5 or

                        The rare, off-kilter bars of five or seven beats 
                        are unequally wieghted two-beat bars:
                        2 + 3

                        This representation of bar structure corresponds 
                        to the quantitative conceptualization; it is the 
                        translation of the absolute measures of time into the 
                        absolute measures of length (mensural-rhythmic).
                        Inherent to it is the shortcoming that, with just the 
                        length measures themselves, we cannot conclusively 
                        assign fixed values to the bar units (indicated by 
                        the bar lines).

                        This shows us the path to another type of 
                        representation that will do better justice, from a 
                        sensorial point of view, to the essence of the bar 
                        structures. This representation would illustrate 
                        the quality of the parts of the bar especially 
                        clearly. It would be the representation of the 
                        relationships among weights, the qualitative 
                        treatment of the bar structures (weight-rhythmic)

                        By observing a conductor, we can obtain more

                        On such a foundation I can now attempt to represent

                        I choose two bars from a work in three voices by Bach

                            Since music without dynamics sounds mechanical and expression-

                            the line more or less weight, analogous to the quality of 
                            the tone, while the quantitative representation is expressed

                        With this example (insert, fig. 22), which attempts 
                        to represent, pictorially and objectively, a thing 
                        that is simultaneously abstract and absolutely real, 
                        we can learn quite a few things: first of all, the 
                        possibility of this new representation in itself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        : Furthermore, we can identify the relationship 
                        among the two or three "voices," which pertains to 
                        their place according to length and height;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        : Their relationship among each other, which 
                        pertains to their degree of individualization. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One moment it is two voices, the next it is 
                        three that sound together (and occasionally a single 
                        voice could even sound alone).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Both voices in the first bar (the second and 
                        third voices) differ greatly with regards to their 
                        individualization. The lower voice has a distinctly 
                        structural character in comparison with the higher 
                        voice, which remains individual.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When it enters later, the first voice begins 
                        somewhat lower than the second, seeking to leap over 
                        it, which at first it fails to do. Only after the 
                        short pause in the second voice does the first attain 
                        its coveted predominance. With the individualized 
                        entry of the first voice, the second is demoted to 
                        a structural character; due to its higher position 
                        in agreeable contrast to the third (which at this 
                        point dips slightly), the second voice makes an arc 
                        under which the first voice moves individually.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the yielding pause, the second voice runs 
                        parallel to the third.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The third voice remains true to its structural 
                        character from the beginning up to the point where 
                        the second joins it in parallel; here one can detect 
                        a timid attempt at individuality.

                        A glance at the quantities of the example (insert, 
                        fig. 22) also shows that the mensural differences 
                        are based on simple and adjacent numbers. Were 
                        ratios of very small numbers to very large ones to

                        The time before last, I established the moment 
                        of repetition as a characteristic of structural 
                        rhythms. With a few structural examples that 
                        were fundamental due to their primitivity, we 
                        obtained, by measuring and weighing, series 
                        like:
                        1  to  1  to  1  to  1  to  1
                        or like  1+2  to  1+2  to  1+2  to  1+2
                        "   " 11+10  to  11+10  to  11+10,
                        for which we substituted the series I to I to I to I,
                        with the Roman numeral one understood as a 
                        compound unit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the realm of two dimensions, in a plane, 
                        instead of these series we obtained complexes 
                        like
                        I  I  I  I
                        I  I  I  I
                        I  I  I  I
                        I  I  I  I
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In contrast to these characters, we considered 
                        individual rhythms, taking as their basis numbers  
                        with which the moment of repetition was precluded. 
                        The prime numbers appeared to be particularly 
                        suited for this: 
                        3 to 5 to 7 to 11 to 13 to 17 to 19 to 23, etc.
                        In the following exercise, "Combination of structural

                        and individual rhythms," I warned against 
                        proceeding mathematically, because the theory 
                        is after all just an ordering of intuitively 
                        available things and plays only a retroactive 
                        role in the creative process--the role of 
                        criticism, brought to bear retroactively.

                        following the individuum's trail, step by step.

                        Let us assume that fig. 1 represents the 
                        individuum. Proof: no repetition. Like an upbeat it 
                        begins at A with seventeen, plummets by a value of 
                        twenty-three, bends at a wide angle to the right with 
                        thirteen, rises vertically with three, angles left 
                        with two, drops diagonally with nineteen, angles left 
                    </p>

                        with fifteen to 
                        the endpoint Z.N
                        (I ask, meanwhile, 
                        that the numbers
                        be understood not 
                        quantitatively, but 
                        qualitatively.) 
                        The result is 
                        three circumscribed 
                        planes of a non
                        repeating, and there

                        (to fig. 2)
                        With fig. 2, the structural character comes into play. 
                        The plummeting vertical divides into five, five times,* 
                        the individual thirteen in a series of threes, followed 
                        by several twos, several threes, sixes, etc.

                        Regarding the combined figure (2), it still must be 
                        said that the measures of the individual rhythm are 
                        greater than the measures of the structure and that 
                        the individual (line-)trajectory is qualitative (or 
                        weighing), in comparison to the structure that is 
                        kept purely quantitative (measuring). *Note!

                        In this case (fig. 3) you can speak of a two-voiced 
                        trajectory, in which the individual theme is not 
                        repeatedly intersected by the structural theme, as 
                        in the previous example, but only now and then, not 
                        even in every segment.N Consequently, one cannot 
                        deny the structural theme a certain independence. It 
                        is aware of this and takes on a dynamic character 
                        in its trajectory. The individuum feels magnificent 
                        because of its higher distinctiveness, it requires 
                        no special accentuation of its ego, and it goes along 
                        separately, in quantitative stillness, flute-like, in 
                        spite of the companionship of the heavy structural

                        * I recently translated a musical construct into a 
                        pictorial construct. So now I can also think of the 
                        reverse and ask myself, how would our individuum, 
                        with its structure, sound as music? Undoubtedly as 
                        pure melody with purely accompanying subordinate 
                        forms.

                        characters corresponds to the ratios in the first 
                        example (fig. 2). The measures of the individual rhythm 
                        contain the higher numbers.

                        In this new example (fig. 4), if one disregards the verticals,  
                        the structural part may be analyzed very primitively as a re- 
                        peated ratio of 1 to 1 to 1 to 1 to 1 to 1. (horizontal parallels)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The verticals, a bit more developed rhythmically, introduce 
                        something new, namely, alternation in pairs:
                        2a  +  2b  +  2a  +  2b 
                        (vertical alternation)
                        (1+1) (1+1)  (1+1) (1+1) (horizontal parallels)
                        Or, 
                        in sum I to I
                        In this linear representation of the structure, the manner of expression  
                        is purely mensural. If one thinks of the squares in alternating colors,*
                        The individual part of this example shows us several individuums

                        * then one must take into account the fact that different colors  
                        indicate the strongest (psychological) dynamism and that great  
                        restraint is demanded of the individuum.

                        Where they are articulated, the articulation is based 
                        on individual numbers. Their expression is dynamic 
                        (weighing) in comparison to the purely mensural 
                        manner of expression of the structural part.

                        Comparison of the 3 examples.
                        The first example (fig. 2) was melodic with 
                        structural accompaniment, therefore, a dominant 
                        individuum.

                    <p>
                        The second (fig. 3) was thematic in two voices, 
                        with dynamic accentuation of the relatively structural 
                        part, therefore, a delicate individuum.

                        This third example is a kind of emblem of the 
                        happy individuum or of happy individuums, which are 
                        able to arrange themselves rigorously over a wide 
                        area in conformity with the set structural pattern, 
                        without detracting from their individual character.

                        produced a dynamic particularly rich in contrast, ranging 
                        from light to very deep dark, from the way in which 
                        they overlapped, because the light was meant to shine 
                        through it from behind, as with a glass window.

                        In the deep dark tonality, there was already a 
                        transition to the individual. However, the individuum 
                        received its full, most highly dynamic force of 
                        expression through the rhythmization of the squares 
                        into the complexes according to their color type: blue, 
                        red, violet, etc.

                        we worked from terrestrial, human assumptions, 
                        from the way in which we are affixed to the 
                        earth, from our restricted possibilities of

                        The simplest symbol for this force of attraction is 
                        the plumbline,  the simple vertical. The weighing 
                        scales, however, take this 
                        perpendicular into account; 
                        the perpendicular is the

                        physical-human dependence on this terrestrial 
                        force facilitates our ability to draw conclusions 
                        about our fellow sufferer of this force--the 
                        construction, the physical work.

                        In practice, our limited physical size and 
                        range of action compel us to start from the 
                        component, from the part of the whole.

                        That it is our lot to be thus bound should not 
                        discourage us from recognizing that above us, things 
                        can be otherwise, that there are regions where other 
                        laws hold, for which new symbols will have to be 
                        found, corresponding to movement that is looser and 
                        to places that are more mobile.

                        it, he can indulge in new possibilities of movement.

                        little to be done. One is left to forces like air 
                        currents or cooler and warmer air. The way in which 
                        air masses of differing temperature flow into one

                    <p>
                        I am beginning today with criticism of an imperfect 
                        solution to the last exercise, but by no means wish 
                        to imply that there were fewer good solutions than 
                        previously. I am likewise reluctant to reprove the 
                        author of the imperfect solution; rather, I would 
                        like to use his error as an opportunity for remarks 
                        from which we may all learn and benefit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The exercise was based upon the previous theoretical 
                        remarks about rigid and loose articulation. It was 
                        called, "Combination of rigidly articulated characters 
                        with loosely articulated characters into an organic 
                        whole (the composition)." 
                    </p>
                    <p> In this regard, I made several suggestions:</p>
                    <p>
                        1)  to treat the rigid articulation individually and 
                        to subordinate the loose articulation in support 
                        of the individuum. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Or, 2)  to dedicate the loose articulation to the 
                        individuum, and (conversely) to keep the rigid 
                        articulation structural.
                    </p>
                <pb/>
                    <p>
                       In music, both ways of treating two characters are 
                        described as melodic (solo voice with accompaniment).
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        Thirdly, I suggested letting both kinds of articu
                        lation struggle for equivalence, which in music is 
                        called thematic treatment.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Or, fourth, treating both types of articulation 
                        as having the same power, so that they would not 
                        struggle against each other but rather, amicably 
                        complementing each other, they would mutually and 
                        alternately grant the upper hand. Once again, an 
                        example of thematic treatment.

                        quite simple forms and established a rhythm with 
                        dynamic light and dark accentuation, on the one hand,

                        So, are both these characters suitable 
                        examples of rigid and fluid articulation?
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        To begin with the first character,
                        What is this?

                        It is a plane that approaches the  
                        linear in an upright direction,
                        like this <graphic url="..."/> or <graphic url="..."/> this.

                        And what is

                    <p>
                        It is a rigidly articulated expansion and contraction of 
                        a row of planes that approach linearity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The expansion and contraction develops in a hori- 
                        zontal direction, like this <graphic url="..."/> or this <graphic url="..."/>. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The sense of which can also be represented in the 
                        following manner:

                    <p>
                        The first character (fig. 1) therefore conforms to the 
                        exercise. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But what about the second character? Does the row of 
                        swelling and shrinking circles correspond to the task? 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Yes, since the articulation around a common point cannot 
                        be described as rigid, much less when fig. 6 allows for 
                        other interpretations, such as in fig. 7,
                    </p>

                        <graphic url=".../lesson6_fig8"/>

                    <p>or their variants, 7a and 8a.</p>

                    <p>
                        So the row of circles as a loosely articulated 
                        character also corresponds quite closely to the 
                        proposed task.

                    <p>
                        Now, how did both characters behave in relation 
                        to one another in the solution I objected to? 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If, on the one hand, we had an individuum and, 
                        on the other, a structural character, then we could 
                        resort to guessing and try our luck. But here both 
                        characters are developed equally little. I remember 
                        that they behaved like this,

                        in relation to 
                        each other.

                    <p>
                        <cb n="left"/> Or, actually, like this:

                        <cb n="right"/>And that means?
                    </p>
                <pb/>
                    <p> Alas, nothing in the sense of the proposed task.</p>
                    <p>
                        In itself, it could well mean something, namely, 
                        either a bipartite or tripartite unit, perhaps an 
                        everyday object like a lamp with a base, globe, and 
                        cylinder,
                    </p>
                    <p>

                    <p>or a pot-bellied vase,<graphic url="..."/></p>
                    <p> or a clock pendulum,<graphic url="..."/> or any object at all: <graphic url="..."/></p>
                    <p>
                        However, the requirement, a "Composition based on 
                        two characters" no doubt permits manifold solutions, 
                        except that their fusion into a single thing is not 
                        possible,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        because <graphic url="..."/> or <graphic url="..."/> is no organic confrontation
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        between <graphic url="..."/> circle and <graphic url="..."/> straight line!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nor is the repetition of this motif a solution to 
                        the question!
                    </p>
                    <figure>
                        <graphic url=".../lesson6_fig12"/>

                    <p>
                        So that we may more easily assess this motif by translating 
                        it into a material case, with this construct (fig. 12), for 
                        example, we can imagine a row of pieces of wood of unequal 
                        weight, shaped like piano keys,
                        <graphic url="..."/> upon which the tops

                        <cb n="left"/>
                        of tin cans have
                        been placed:

                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        In this case, there are no longer unified objects 
                        but rather two material characters without a visible 
                        relationship, merely superimposed, completely 
                        lacking spirit.

                    <p>In short: the</p>

                        relation less ness

                    <p>
                        Thus, once again nothing! But what can one do 
                        so that it becomes something?

                    <p>
                        So as to continue imagining this in material 
                        terms, let us first of all leave the row of wooden 
                        pieces of different weights at rest where they are, 
                        but instead of the circular planes made of tin, 
                        atop the wooden pieces we will place a bull's-eye 
                        of crown glass or optical lenses or glass spheres.
                        And,  visibly, something will occur, 
                        namely, the pic- <graphic url="..."/> -torial expression of 
                        the relationship between two hetero-
                        geneous things.

                        The struggle of the aggressive straight line against 
                        the inherently quiescent circle, and the defeat of the 
                        straight line when it falls within the dangerous region 
                        of its partner. Struggle at the expense of the straight

                        The following example teaches us another way 
                        pictorially to express the relationship between two 
                        heterogeneous things (fig. 18 and following):

                        Further examples would not contribute anything

                        motifs or the other and will have a configuration 
                        of struggle or of friendship. The struggle can be 
                        carried out with varying sharpness; friendship can 
                        be based on unilateral or mutual adaptation.

                        the straight line as masculine, on account of 
                        its spontaneous activity, and if, conversely, I 
                        designate the circle as feminine in its inherent 
                        quiescence.

                        Now, in our example that provided the occasion for 
                        this criticism, however, the motifs we have just 
                        discussed in terms of the extended compositional 
                        configuration were handled in a manner so unrelated 
                        that one could say,

                        "The men are monks, the women are nuns, and, despite 
                        the close proximity of the two cloisters, no life

                        My previous discussions of the structural concept 
                        dealt with the most primitive structural type based on 
                        repeating rhythms.

                    <p>
                        In the practical exercises, however, a structural 
                        element often appeared that rose above this primitivity. 
                        I found no reason to object to a structural element 
                        of this kind as long as a higher development stood 
                        against it or rested above it, qua individuum.

                        The science of anatomy teaches us, usually by way 
                        of introduction, to recognize in their structure the 
                        matter from which plants or animals are constructed. 
                        A knife is used for this purpose. This science 
                        understands structure as the grouping of the smallest 
                        corpuscles of matter that are visible with the naked 
                        eye or a microscope.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Matter that, for example, has undergone the ravages 
                        of erosion offers similar structural images.

                    <p>
                        In any case, one can perhaps even detect with the 
                        naked eye the rhythm of the corpuscles in a bone, the 
                        result of which is a multitude of cavities akin to 
                        cells* or tubes or channels.

                        In a similar fashion, one can detect the structure 
                        of cartilage, ligaments, tendons, and muscles, etc.

                        Enough, then, about the material structure and 
                        about the rhythm of the material that the organs 
                        and the organism are made of. Let us now visualize 
                        the organism as a movement-machine, in which the 
                        execution of the movement and the will to move 
                        interlock, and let us build up from subservient 
                        elements to governing elements.

                    <p>
                        Here let matter be a precondition in the entire 
                        domain of action; it should be everywhere.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, if we first consider the bones' relation- 
                        ship to one another, interacting to make the 
                        skeleton, then we recognize straightaway that even 
                        in a resting position they need to be held
                    </p>
                <pb/> 
                    <p>together. The ligaments see to this.</p> 
                    <p>
                        <cb n="left"/><graphic url=".../lesson6_fig30"/>
                        <cb n="right"/>
                        The ligaments connect 
                        several bones, they 
                        serve the bones, their 
                        function is subordinate, 
                        they provide support 
                        by connecting, they are 
                        subordinated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Their function, as such, has a structural character 
                        in relation to the bones' higher task of movement.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Therefore, in arranging the 
                        schema of action, I will allow the  
                        ligament only a little space, but 
                        somewhat more space for the bone:

                    <p>
                        If I consider the relationship of bone to muscle 
                        with regard to the movement-organism, 
                    </p>

                        then I recognize that 
                        here the tendon carries 
                        out a similar mediating 
                        function as did the 
                        ligament previously, 
                        in the way in which the 
                        tendon joins the muscle 
                        to the bone (fig. 32).
                    </p>
                    <p>And how does the muscle relate to the bone?</p>
                    <figure>
                        <cb n="left"/><graphic url=".../lesson6_fig33"/>

                    <p>
                        It can force the bone into a new position, since 
                        the muscle has the ability to contract and, in the 
                        process, to shorten itself. And, at the same time, 
                        tendons and ligaments help by tenaciously holding 
                        tight. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The angle between two bones must change because the 
                        muscle wills it. The muscle's function of movement
                    </p>
                <pb/> 
                    <p>
                        is therefore of a higher order than the bones' 
                        function of movement. The passivity of the bone 
                        depends on the activity of the muscle. The function 
                        of the bone is functional-structural in relation 
                        to the function of the muscle. It helps the muscle 
                        translate the movement-command (wherever it comes 
                        from) into action.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Therefore, in my schema of the action of 
                        movement, I allow a larger space for the muscle, 
                        and leave the tendon to mediate between them.  
                    </p>

                        The muscles perform mutually independent functions.
                    </p>
                <pb/> 
                    <p>
                        Each muscle has a specific task; one bends the 
                        organ, the other stretches it, etc. Here, too, we 
                        observe functioning of a higher order than that of 
                        the bone, which can achieve nothing by itself but 
                        only in conjunction with a second bone. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But since we have already mentioned the word 
                        "movement-command," the muscle's active self-mastery 
                        extends only so far. It obeys as soon as the command 
                        reaches it; it does not want to act but must act; at 
                        most it wants to obey.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It obeys the brain's command, transmitted 
                        telegraphically by the nerve cord.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our schema of the action of movement is again 
                        expanded:

                        What do we learn (from fig. 35)? We recognize, first  
                        of all, the relativity of serving and governing, of 
                        structural and individual functioning: as a whole, a

                        "That which is greater requires more room." The direc- 
                        tion is eccentric. Higher values withdraw further 
                        and further from the central point; the significance 
                        increases as we go from the center away towards the 
                        periphery.

                        Monday, February 27, 1922
                    </p>
                    <p> The exercise from the last meeting was:</p>
                    <p>
                        Tripartite organism;
                        First organ, active character (brain)
                        Second organ, medial character (muscle)
                        Third organ, passive character (bone)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Brain, muscle and bone were not to be represented 
                        as such but rather were to be understood schematically, 
                        in view of their position within the animal movement
                        organism that I had discussed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The concepts of active, medial, and passive can be 
                        best explained in philological or linguistic terms:
                        If I say, "I impel," it is an active form.
                        If I say, "I am impelled," it is the linguistic expres- 
                        sion of the passive.
                        But the expression of the medial form would be: 
                        I integrate myself, I fit myself in, 
                        I make friends of myself. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is also worth noting that the ancient languages 
                        of the civilized nations could form the passive voice 
                        without an auxiliary verb, purely morphologically, 
                        by means of a particular verb ending. I still even 
                        remember the pure medial form in Greek, expressed 
                        only in the verb ending, with no pronoun whatsoever. 
                        The modern languages no longer convey these three 
                        characters by means of purely synthetic verbal forms, 
                        using for this purpose instead several roundabout 
                        combinations of words.  
                    </p>
                    <p>As for the rank of these three characters, active,</p>
                <pb/> 
                    <p>
                        medial, and passive, it will depend on different 
                        points of view.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Conceptually, the active would be classified as 
                        principal, because the impulse to move starts in the 
                        brain, because in it resides thought, the father of 
                        all more highly developed action.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From the material point of view, the order would 
                        be the inverse, and we would say that the rigid 
                        matter, the bone, first realizes the movement and 
                        that it belongs in first place. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is not necessary to set the two points of view 
                        against each other. What is essential is the organically 
                        shared unity of the three as left, center, and right 
                        organs or as right, center, and left organs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Considering the particular difficulty of the 
                        exercise I counted myself satisfied with solutions 
                        whose organic coherence was plainly evident,
                        on the one hand, in the form of the organs
                        themselves,
                        on the other, in the emphasis given in this form's
                        representation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First example: the water mill <graphic url=".../lesson7_fig1"/>
                        principal organ: the water 
                        other organs:  two wheels,one large and one 
                        small, connected by a drive-belt.
                        Criticism:  a) Formal error in the choice of 
                        the lower organs, because in the 
                        relationship of significance to 
                        the principal organ, there is 
                        no stepwise organic tripartite 
                        division.
                        b) Formal error in the shape of 
                        the main organ; its form is at best a
                    </p>
                <pb/>
                    <p>
                        conventional undulating structure just the way you 
                        "do water," but not an outstanding configuration of 
                        a main organ.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        c) Error of emphasis: the principal organ, water, 
                        is treated too lightly in dynamic terms.   
                    </p>

                            Correction: (fig. 2)

                        <graphic url=".../lesson7_fig2"/>
                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        a) Relationally correct choice of organs: I. The 
                        waterfall, active, brain; II. The coupled wheels, 
                        medial, muscle; III. The hammer, passive, bone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        b) Relationally correct formation of organs: The 
                        principal organ is articulated with the greatest 
                        individuality; the others are articulated decreasingly 
                        so, by steps.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        c) Relationally correct emphasis of organs: I. with 
                        principal energy, II. with medium energy, III. with 
                        negligible energy.

                    <p>
                        As a result, as far as configuration and emphasis are 
                        concerned, the erroneousness of fig. 3 in relational 
                        terms should be readily apparent. The most improbable
                    </p>
                <pb/> 
                    <p>
                        scenario arises: the medial organ has become the 
                        principal organ.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (Example one A):
                        With the choice of organs, I can expand 
                        the failed example (fig. 1) upwards as well, instead 
                        of downwards (as was the case when the hammer 
                        was added). So we remove the hammer, the wheel 
                        becomes III, the water becomes II, and I shall 
                        think of something new for I. This proves easier, 
                        since flowing water does not yet correspond to any 
                        originating initiative.   
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        We are familiar with the earth's force of gravity 
                        (fig. 4),
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        just as we are familiar with the horizontal 
                        corresponding to the level of "standing" water:   
                    </p>

                        <graphic url=".../lesson7_fig5"/>
                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        Without the mountains A and B hemming it in, the water 
                        would drain off on both sides:
                    </p>
                    <figure>
                        <graphic url=".../lesson7_fig6"/>
                    </figure>
                <pb/>
                    <p>
                        If we remove mountain B and leave mountain A standing, 
                        then the water only flows off to the right. As a 
                        result, two forces are at work, first gravity, second 
                        the obstructing mountain (fig. 7). 
                    </p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        These two forces result in the diagonal of the 
                        parallelogram of forces: II, the force of the flowing 
                        water.

                        In linguistic terms:
                        I: "We impel." (active)
                        II: "I resign myself," 
                        but I is held respon- 
                        sible, lest anyone  
                        further down suffer  
                        (medial).
                    </p>

                        <cb n="right"/>
                        And someone does  
                        suffer it:
                        III: the wheel, which  
                        says,
                        "I am turned" (passive). 
                        (fig. 9)

                    <p>
                        Erroneous emphasis in this variant of the example 
                        looks like this:

                        Another example:  I: Let the active force be the

                        let the relational complex (humus/seed/
                        nourishment/growth/taking root)

                        the light and in 
                        the open air, the 
                        respiratory organs 
                        form: one or two 
                        leaves, 
                        and more leaves,
                        and more leaves.
                        III: As a result, the 
                        flower, at which 
                        point the plant is

                        Variant for another example: With the function of the 
                        flower, the sexual phase begins, which 
                        serves the purposes of reproduction.
                        Here, in that case, one could perhaps 
                        claim the following as characteristic 
                        for our tripartite order:
                        as I: stamen and pollen,
                        as II: the mediation of insects,
                        as III: the fertilized seeds.

                    <p>Third example: circulation</p>
                    <p>
                       We could broaden our studies of nature in the field 
                        of anatomy yet further, from the realm of voluntary 
                        movement to that of involuntary movement. 
                    </p> 
                    <p></p>
                    <p> 
                        Voluntary movement occurs, as the expression 
                        indicates, following a command, according to the 
                        requirements of the authority we commonly call the 
                        brain. It hardly ever applies to the entire movement 
                        apparatus, but rather sets merely partial couplings 
                        into action. This part of the animal movement-machine 
                        is subject to fatigue; the norm here is fatigue, 
                        sluggishness, and, when called for, suspension (in 
                        sleep).
                    </p>

                        The involuntary movements of the other part of the 
                        machine: of the heart, of the lungs, of the digestive 
                        and excretive systems. These involuntary movements do 
                        not cease during a lifetime. Here fatigue, sluggishness, 
                        and missing a beat are not allowed for.

                        All this as a postscript to our last exercise... 
                        The schematic concision of my presentation has probably 
                        been evident to you; on the one hand it clarifies 
                        matters plainly while, on the other, it leaves open to 
                        you the most diverse ways of configuring the formal 
                        concepts and relationships we have examined.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, in order to configure formal relationships 
                        of this type (made even more specific in our exercise), 
                        namely, movement (in our special case, movement that is 
                        elicited, transmitted, and compelled)--in order to let 
                        the relationships of movement, on the basis of analytic 
                        abstraction, return to their nature, to the work's 
                        own nature--for that purpose, we shall still require 
                        something beyond a clearly thought-out schema.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What does movement in the work actually mean? As a 
                        rule, after all, our works won't be moving, will they? 
                        We are, after all, not an automaton factory!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        No, most of our works will, of their own accord, 
                        remain at rest in their place. Yet, nevertheless, they 
                        are wholly movement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Movement is proper to all becoming, and before the 
                        work is, the work becomes, just like the world. Before 
                        it was--according to the quotation, "in the beginning 
                        God created..."--it became; and furthermore, it becomes 
                        before in the future it is.
                        will be 
                    </p>
                <pb/> 
                    <p>
                        The work becomes: stone upon stone or, from the 
                        block, piece from piece.

                    <p>
                        That is the initial productive-movement, the 
                        beginning action of the one who is creating. This 
                        beginning action is already of a temporal nature, 
                        whether it remains flat or results in a volume: this 
                        takes time. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Shortly after this initial productive-movement, 
                        the first counter-movement already begins with the 
                        creator: the initial receptive-movement. Or, in 
                        everyday language, he inspects what he has made up to 
                        this point. ("...And he saw that it was good," as it 
                        is written.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once again, a temporal process. Only the tiniest  
                        thing of all--the point, dead unto itself--is timeless.  
                        As soon as this point becomes movement and line, it 
                        requires time, in the same way as when this line is 
                        pushed to produce a plane or when the movement of 
                        planes produces volumes. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From a cosmic standpoint, movement is actually a 
                        given, and as an infinite force it requires no special 
                        energetic impetus. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The inhibition, by matter, of this given 
                        movement results in the quiescence of things in the 
                        earthly sphere. It is misguided to assume that this 
                        adhesion to the earth is the norm.

                    <p>
                        The history of the work, which is first and 
                        foremost genesis, can be described briefly in broad 
                        strokes as a hidden spark from somewhere that, 
                        glowing, ignites the human spirit, moves the human 
                        hand and from there is transmitted as movement of 
                        matter; it becomes work.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The receptive process is equivalent. The beholder (who 
                        can be the same as the creator) goes, so to speak, in the 
                        opposite direction. But the beholder, too, is completely 
                        moved in time.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In just physical terms: The eye does not register 
                        forms on even the simplest plane with simultaneously 
                        equal intensity. It lacks the physical capacity to do so, 
                        because the retina does not perceive the entire image 
                        with the same acuity,
                    </p>

                        but rather, only the section I adjacent to the point that 
                        can be joined by a straight line with the focal point 
                        of the lens and with the center of visual acuity on the 
                        retina. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the eye wishes to sharply perceive section II of 
                        the object, then it must turn upwards. If it wishes to 
                        perceive section III sharply, then it must be lowered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Eye muscles turn the eye here and there--from left to 
                        right, from corner to corner, around in a circle--and 
                        the sections it sees sharply, one after the other, are 
                        gradually registered in the brain to create an overall 
                        impression. The brain has the capacity to store memory 
                        images and to assemble them into a whole; the eye has the 
                        ability to visit a spot over and over again to inspect 
                        and consolidate.

                    <p>
                        We know full well that the image in the eye is actually inverted, 
                        but this alters essentially nothing at all in the process.

                       Stage I: The beholder perceives the central section, I. 
                        Sections II and III lack sharpness on the retina. The 
                        muscles for lowering and raising the eye are not involved.

                    <p>
                        Stage II: The beholder's eye now 
                        obeys the desire to examine the upper 
                        region clearly. The lower muscle
                        muscle for raising contracts
                    </p>
                <pb/> 
                    <p>
                        becomes active, contracting until it brings the eye into 
                        the new position where the area of acuity on the retina, 
                        the focal point of the lens, and area II of the object 
                        lie in a straight line.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Area I is still perceived but less sharply, while 
                        III, which was previously still perceptible though 
                        without clarity, leaves the field of vision.

                    <p>
                        Stage III (fig.17): The eye should obey the beholder's 
                        desire to perceive the lower region in full sharpness. 
                        For this purpose the muscle for lowering the eye is 
                        able to contract, and the eye follows effortlessly, 
                        until the retina's center of visual acuity, the focal 
                        point of the lens, and part III of the object lie in 
                        a straight line. Thus, I remains visible (though not 
                        sharply), while II leaves the field of vision.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this way the eye, like a grazing animal, scans 
                        a plane not only from bottom to top, but also from 
                        left to right and in every direction, where it has 
                        reason to do so.

                        movement fixed in place.

                        the values that attract it initially, to those that 
                        attract it later, once the first values have been grazed

                        then the eye moves more in leaps and bounds, in the 
                        manner of an animal hunting (fig. 19).

                        and itself movement and flow, then the eye abandons itself 
                        to this current like a little boat, or it sails like a 
                        cloud in lightly or stormily moving winds (fig. 20).

                        eye to a marked degree, because this principal 
                        weight is also located at the most important place; 
                        then the eye oscillates back and forth as it circles 
                        around towards the four 2s and then oscillates 
                        around in a new circle towards the four 3s.

                        We learn: The movement-function of a work need not 
                        be emphasized as such. For as you have seen, the most 
                        quiescent and stable work is also movement.

                        Nevertheless, the question as to the nature of 
                        actual movement-forms, actually dynamic formation, 
                        is very much alive. This can lead us to new, richer 
                        formal domains.

                        The function of a visual work is the way in which 
                        the work's construction, set in motion over time,
                        communicates itself to the eye and the way in which 
                        the character of movement inherent in each work is 
                        imposed upon the eye and upon the powers of reception 
                        lying behind it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here we touch upon the old story of effect, 
                        but through emphasis on the character of movement 
                        inherent in each visual work, not the effect 
                        generally, the effect per se, but the kind of effect 
                        particular to each case.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To differentiate these kinds of effects by classi- 
                        fying them amounts to classifying the types of works.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As we saw last time, every work, even 
                        the most concise, moves within time both as it 
                        emerges (productively) and as it is apprehended 
                        (receptively). Our eye is constructed in such a 
                        way that it scans, over time, all that we perceive 
                        visually.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The eye, wearied of familiar nature or 
                        familiar culture, steers towards new, stimulating 
                        peculiarities. Should it fall to a visual work to 
                        exert such stimuli, then the eye steers towards that 
                        area where, as the greatest force of attraction, 
                        the strongest unfolding of pictorial energy asserts 
                        itself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Such a stimulus is always of a relative 
                        nature. If, on a white plane× that has made the 
                        eye curious, an especially deep black is produced 
                        somewhere, then this black in comparison with that 
                        white is a quite strong energy.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Or when on a green plane enticing closer
                        examination,
                    </p>
                    <p> × my sheet of paper on the blackboard</p>

                    <p>
                        a sharply contrasting red asserts itself, then this 
                        time the red is the special energy. The same applies 
                        to white on black, warm on cool, lively on calm, and 
                        vice versa, higher on lower, stronger on weaker, 
                        harder on softer. Or active on static, and all the 
                        other opposites that, once created, have the power 
                        to wrest the eye towards themselves.

                        With the feeling (which was somewhat reinforced 
                        by the last exercise), with the feeling, that the 
                        explanations from last time were not yet clear 
                        enough, and in order to be able to build more

                        product the most concise construct that cannot emerge 
                        at a single stroke (not even one produced with single

                        Here the reception image or, in short, the recept,

                        We now have before us: there (fig. 1), a planar 
                        image as the product and, here, a linear image as the 
                        recept.

                        <graphic url="..."/> There [fig. 1] the planes are to be thought of as 
                        active planes and here [fig. 2] as active lines, which are 
                        not (mind you!) mutually dependent on one another in the way 
                        they were represented earlier, i.e., as here: <graphic url="..."/> where the 
                        passive lines depend on the active plane, or here: <graphic url="..."/> where 
                        the plane, as opposed to the lines, is the result and is 
                        therefore passive.

                    <p>
                        Therefore: there, active planes and, here, active lines 
                        that are functionally linked with each other.

                        Closer examination of the reception image reveals a 
                        movement gradually retreating from the base of the 
                        force, or a gradually weaker valuation compared with 
                        the fundamental principal value. Sequential order and 
                        ranking order coincide.

                        These red forms of diminishing force are the expression

                        image (fig. 1). At the same time, the new form is 
                        itself again an image and indeed an image with pure 
                        movement-form.

                        This new product consists of nine graded values that, for sim-  
                        plicity's sake, I represent only with quantitative differences. 
                        Language and function would of course find even more vivid

                        For the purpose of configuring the reception, the 
                        centric character of this product leads me to schematize the 
                        gradation of values in the form of nine circles that recede 
                        further and further from the center.

                        The diagonals may also be considered.
                        And, with that, the schema in which  
                        the action of reception is to be played  
                        out has been prepared.

                        Before approaching the product, let us envision the 
                        following little prelude: We have moved about, getting 
                        our exercise for some time in the countryside and are 
                        satisfied and tired after our plein-air impressions, 
                        so that coming back into the dark house feels like a 
                        relief. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The room in which we now find ourselves is 
                        completely black, empty and black. The next room that we 
                        enter is also black with the exception of one painted 
                        wall.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here our thoroughly stimulated eye now pounces on 
                        the pure white note, which I have labeled "first." Then 
                        to the still very light note labeled "second," and next 
                        it proceeds to the remaining values, in increasingly 
                        darker gradations.

                        Thus, the path via the separate stimulus-points arranges 
                        itself in the form of a spiral around the white in the 
                        center. The stimulus-points recede ever further from the 
                        center, while maintaining their relatedness to it.

                        The product (fig. 4) consisted of solemnly stable and 
                        quiescent forms. Its recept, the function of this stably 
                        formed construct, is the purest movement-form conceivable, a 
                        spiral.

                        And so, with every further attempt to represent the 
                        functions of a visual work, we will obtain movement-forms 
                        again and again; the further we advance towards the essence 
                        of the function, the purer the movement-forms.

                        This new product shows, in contrast to before, a now 
                        more erratic arrangement of the values. The preceding 
                        pastorale of the grazing cattle has become the range of 
                        the hunting predator, as will be clearly shown in the 
                        corresponding form of the function.

                        As the first schema to represent this function, to start 
                        with I choose a more epic system (to be read from left 
                        to right) and note on it the values corresponding to the 
                        leaps in value in the product, not in order of rank, but 
                        from bottom to top in the sequence third, fourth, eighth, 
                        ninth, First, fifth, seventh, sixth, second, in which the 
                        particular position of the One at middle height should be 
                        kept in mind. Ranking order and sequential order are not 
                        identical.                    
                    </p>

                        For the second schema, I 
                        choose one that is more 
                        dramatic, with high values 
                        in the middle, therefore 
                        one organized centrally, 
                        and I group values in the 
                        product according to their 
                        proximity to the center: 
                        first (center), eighth, 
                        fifth, ninth, fourth, 
                        seventh, sixth, third, and 
                        second

                    <p>
                        In both schemata, I put the notes in the places that correspond 
                        to the positions of values in the product, and, by connecting 
                        according to rank, I obtain two different recepts that 
                        naturally resemble each other internally to a hair.

                        Having arrived at the dynamic form, we first

                        The movement of a formal element that leads to the 
                        creation of a new formal element need not also produce 
                        a dynamic form. The movement of a point into the mathe

                        indeed a movement-action but not a movement-form. This

                        not a dynamic line because it 
                        is no longer a line at all but 
                        a plane. However, even the

                        plane thus generated (through the line's movement-action) 
                        still need not present a dynamic character as a plane.
                        A visible state of dynamism first arises from gradual 
                        growth or diminution with regard to the quantity or 
                        quality of the energy applied.

                        You will recall the role of the weighing scales,N
                        when we were still stable and static and were weighing 
                        the values against each other on either side. What are the 
                        scales to us now in the measurement of dynamic values? 
                        How shall we weigh things that don't keep still?

                        But perhaps the following bit of imagining has something 
                        calming in itself:

                        This little building is supposed to stand on very small 
                        feet! That won't be very easy. So get the scales over 
                        here, and make that the gold-weighing scales. The weights 
                        tally up: 4 + 1 = 2 + 3. But in practice the thing still 
                        looks rather dubious.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What to do? Let us empathize with it--we who, after 
                        all, are ourselves buildings standing on small feet 
                        and who must not fall down. What do we do in order 
                        not to fall? What do we do when we have not succeeded 
                        in establishing the calm of stasis through a counter
                        balancing shift (on a small scale) of our weighted parts?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First we move a leg (enlargement of the base) and 
                        perhaps the other soon afterwards. And finally we walk; 
                        that makes balancing easier.

                        walk, can it?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It can't walk but perhaps another kind of movement 
                        suits it.

                    <p>
                        Let's not enlarge its base but, instead, let us 
                        place it on a point and set it swinging vigorously in 
                        motion about itself.

                        Then it's called a top, the top that every child knows 
                        does not fall as long as the motion lasts, as long as 
                        the top spins. Just as calming for us can be a rolling 
                        wheel, the boy's hoop, or even the spinning diabolo, 
                        which understands the art of dancing on the high wire.

                        With in principle such calming thoughts,  we will keep 
                        looking for a replacement for the now  "obsolete" 
                        weighing scales.

                        The pendulum is a very ingenious   little instrument 
                        consisting of a small lead weight, w, and a line, 
                        which swings back and forth from a fixed point, p, 
                        the center; the line, as radius, moves with the weight.
                    </p>
                <pb/> 
                    <p>
                        The concept of back and forth is essential here, 
                        i.e., the property of the pendulum that consists in 
                        immediately describing the corresponding counter
                        motion to each motion.

                        This one case of the compensatory unification of 
                        motion and counter-motion is, however, not the only 
                        possibility. We can think of a less machine-like 
                        handling, even a very sensitive manual one. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let us take a very long line × and guide the weight with 
                        appreciable slackness.

                        Handled this way, 
                        the lead describes 
                        both motion and 
                        counter-motion 
                        independently.

                    <p>
                        We can proceed yet further from the slackened manual 
                        handling to the sentimental journey of the central 
                        point, p, and the pendulum-script will become the 
                        transcribed expression of the particular form of that 
                        journey.

                    <p>
                        Here, for example, the pendulum-script is the dynamic 
                        expression of the vertical straight line, and we arrive 
                        at a dynamic variation on the static construction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Furthermore, we could guide the straight form of 
                        the journey dynamically, along a meandering path, or we 
                        could wander in any form we like.

                    <p>
                        Or we could complete the slackening of the line 
                        at the right moment by letting it go, and the pendulum 
                        becomes a gentle sling, writing in this way, and, like 
                        the counter-motions of the fixed pendulum, the slingshot 
                        counter-motion is easy to understand and complete.

                        However, a new phenomenon occurs if, once more allowing 
                        the pendulum to swing quite calmly to and fro, we think 
                        of the force of gravity being abolished suddenly in the 
                        middle of an oscillation (fig. 20), or if we lend the 
                        swing so much force that gravity is defeated.   
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        In this way, with the pendulum no longer bound to the 
                        earth, the cosmic movement-form suddenly arises:
                    </p>
                    <p>The pendulum swings around in a circle.</p>

                    <p>
                        In this closed, endless motion the need for a counter
                        motion ceases, and indeed the pendulum renounces the 
                        counter-motion in the new circumstances.

                        As opposed to the previous force, which I called 
                        the force of gravity, we now become acquainted with a 
                        new force that I call centrifugal force.

                        New journeys are conceivable with the circling 
                        pendulum, too, if the center is set in motion or 
                        if movement starts with the radius being either 
                        lengthened, upon which ever wider circles sweep out, or 
                        shortened, upon which the circles grow ever tighter, 
                        until the lovely spectacle dies with a jerk, in the 
                        point.

                        The latter is the story of the spiral. Its movement 
                        is no longer endless, inherently quiescent, and so 
                        the question of direction of motion is raised. We must 
                        know this direction because the question dependent on 
                        the lengthening or shortening of the radius (fig. 22a) 
                        is essentially psychic. It runs: Do I loosen myself 
                        from the center in ever freer movement? Or will my

                        movements become more and more bound to a center until 
                        it finally swallows me whole?
